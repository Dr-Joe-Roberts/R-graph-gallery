# About
***

This page showcases the work of [Tuo Wang](https://tuowang.rbind.io/) that 
introduces packages to make [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) plots 
more beautiful. You can find the original code on Tuo's blog 
[here](https://tuowang.rbind.io/post/2021-03-25-ggplot2-extensions/).

Thanks to him for accepting sharing his work here! Thanks also to 
[TomÃ¡s Capretto](https://tcapretto.netlify.app/) who split the original code 
into this step-by-step guide!

## Load packages
***

As usual, it is first necessary to load some packages before building the figure.
[ggrepel](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/articles/examples.html) provides geoms for
`ggplot2` to repel overlapping text labels. Text labels repel away from each other,
away from data points, and away from edges of the plotting area in an automatic
fashion. Also, [`randomNames`](https://centerforassessment.github.io/randomNames/) 
is used to generate random names that will be the text labels in the chart.

**Note:** `randomNames` is only available for R > 4.0.0.

```{r}
library(ggrepel)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(randomNames)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Load and prepare the dataset
***

The palmerpenguins data were collected and made available by 
[Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) 
and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/), a member of 
the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/). This dataset 
was popularized by [Allison Horst](https://www.allisonhorst.com/) in her R 
package [`palmerpenguins`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) with 
the goal to offer an alternative to the iris dataset for data exploration and 
visualization.

```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

<br>

First of all, observations with missing values are discarded from the dataset.

```{r}
penguins <- drop_na(penguins)
```
<br>

Then, each observation is assined a random name. A new variable `highlight` is
added to the dataset to indicate which names are highlighted in the plot. These
are the names starting with the letter `"C"`.

```{r}
## Generate random names
# The results of set.seed may depends on R version.
set.seed(2021+03+27)
name_vector <- randomNames(nrow(penguins), which.names = "first")

## Create 'highlight' indicator variable
penguins <- penguins %>% 
  mutate(
    name = name_vector,
    highlight = case_when(
      str_starts(name, "C") ~ name,
      TRUE ~ ""
      )
    ) 
```

<br>

## Basic chart
***

Today's chart is a scatterplot that shows the association between the flip 
length and the bill length of the penguins in the dataset. Point are colored 
according to the species to add an extra layer of information to the 
vizualisation. The first step is to create a basic colored scatterplot with 
`ggplot2`. Let's get started!


```{r}
# Note `color = species` and s`hape = species`.
# This means each species will have BOTH  a different color and shape.
plt <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(
    aes(color = species, shape = species),
    size = 1.5, 
    alpha = 0.8 # It's nice to add some transparency because there may be overlap.
  ) +
  # Use custom colors
  scale_color_manual(
    values = c("#386cb0", "#fdb462", "#7fc97f")
  )
```
  
```{r, include=FALSE}
ggsave(
  filename = here::here("img", "fromTheWeb", "web-scatterplot-and-ggrepel-preview1.png"),
  width = 6,
  height = 6,
  plot = plt
)
```

<center>
![](img/fromTheWeb/web-scatterplot-and-ggrepel-preview1.png){width=70%}
</center>

That's a pretty good start, but let's make it better!

## Add labels with no overlap

What's truely missing here are **labels**. It's very frustrating not knowing 
which item is hidden under a data point, isn't it!?

It is pretty challenging to add many labels on a plot since labels tend to 
overlap each other, making the figure unreadable. Fortunately, the `ggrepel`
package is here to help us. It provides an algorithm that will automatically 
place the labels for us. Let's do it!

```{r}
plt <- plt + 
  geom_text_repel(
    aes(label = highlight),
    family = "Poppins",
    size = 3,
    min.segment.length = 0, 
    seed = 42, 
    box.padding = 0.5,
    max.overlaps = Inf,
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.010, "npc")),
    nudge_x = .15,
    nudge_y = .5,
    color = "grey50"
  )
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
ggsave(
  filename = here::here("img", "fromTheWeb", "web-scatterplot-and-ggrepel-preview2.png"),
  plot = plt,
  width = 6,
  height = 6,
  device = "png"
)
```

Isn't it wonderful how well `ggrepel` works?

## Final chart
***
  
The chart above is pretty close from being publication ready. What's needed now 
is a good title, a legend to make color and shapes more insightful, and some 
axis customization:

```{r}
plt <- plt + 
  # Add axes labels, title, and subtitle
  labs(
    title = "Palmer Penguins Data Visualization",
    subtitle = "Scatter plot of flipper lenth vs bill length",
    x = "flip length (mm)",
    y = "bill length (mm)"
  ) +  
  theme(
    # The default font when not explicitly specified
    text = element_text(family = "Lobster Two", size = 8, color = "black"),
    
    # Customize legend text, position, and background.
    legend.text = element_text(size = 9, family = "Roboto"),
    legend.title = element_text(face = "bold", size=12, family = "Roboto"),
    legend.position = c(1, 0),
    legend.justification = c(1, 0),
    legend.background = element_blank(),
    # This one removes the background behind each key in the legend
    legend.key = element_blank(),
    
    # Customize title and subtitle font/size/color
    plot.title = element_text(
      family = "Lobster Two", 
      size = 20,
      face = "bold", 
      color = "#2a475e"
    ),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(
      family = "Lobster Two", 
      size = 15, 
      face = "bold", 
      color = "#1b2838"
    ),
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    
    # Adjust axis parameters such as size and color.
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10, color = "black"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    # Axis lines are now lighter than default
    axis.line = element_line(colour = "grey50"),
    
    # Only keep y-axis major grid lines, with a grey color and dashed type.
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "#b4aea9", linetype ="dashed"),
    
    # Use a light color for the background of the plot and the panel.
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#fbf9f4", color = "#fbf9f4"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#fbf9f4", color = "#fbf9f4")
  )
```

<br>

```{r, include=FALSE}
ggsave(
  filename = here::here("img", "fromTheWeb", "web-scatterplot-and-ggrepel.png"),
  plot = plt,
  width = 6,
  height = 6,
  device = "png"
)
```
