# About
***

This page showcases the work of [Georgios Karamanis](https://karaman.is/), built 
for the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) initiative. 
You can find the original code on his Github repository [here](https://github.com/gkaramanis/tidytuesday/blob/master/2021/2021-week34/lemurs.R).

Thanks to him for accepting sharing his work here! Thanks also to 
[Tom√°s Capretto](https://tcapretto.netlify.app/) who split the original code 
into this step-by-step guide! üôèüôè

As a teaser, here is the plot we‚Äôre gonna try building:

# Load packages
***

Today's chart uses the [`tidyverse`](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/) and 
[`ggrepel`](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/). The `tidyverse` is going to load the 
very well known `dplyr` and `ggplot2` libraries, among others, and `ggrepel` 
will make it extremely easy to automatically position labels.

<br>

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)
```
<br>

This post uses the **Fira Sans Compressed** and the **Faune** fonts. If you are
a little unsure about how to work with custom fonts in R, 
[this post](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/custom-fonts-in-R-and-ggplot2) is 
for you.


# Load and prepare the data
***

The data for this post originally comes from the 
[Duke Lemur Center](https://lemur.duke.edu/) and was cleaned by 
[Jesse Mostipak](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues/204). 
This guide uses the dataset released for the 
[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) initiative on the 
week of 2021-08-24. You can find the original announcement and more information 
about the data 
[here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-08-24/readme.md). 
Thank you all for making this work possible! üôèüôè

Two datasets are needed today. The first one, called `lemurs`, has information 
about the lemurs themselves, while `taxonomy` is going to be helpful to obtain 
the latin names of the species.

```{r}
lemurs <- readr::read_csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-08-24/lemur_data.csv"
)

taxonomy <- readr::read_csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-08-24/taxonomy.csv"
)
```
<br>

Now let's compute the largest age recorded and the number of animals by species 
and sex:

```{r}
lem_longev <- lemurs %>% 
  # Keep unique combinations of the following variables.
  distinct(dlc_id, taxon, sex, age_max_live_or_dead_y) %>% 
  # Drop observations with Not Determined sex
  filter(sex != "ND") %>% 
  # Compute highest age and the number of lemurs for each specie and sex
  group_by(taxon, sex) %>% 
  summarise(longev = max(age_max_live_or_dead_y, na.rm = TRUE), n = n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  # Pivot the data so we have two columns for each 'age_max' and 'count',
  # one if for Females and the other is for Males
  pivot_wider(id_cols = taxon, names_from = sex, values_from = c(longev, n)) %>% 
  # Create a column with the colors.
  # When female live longer, use blue. Otherwise, use orange.
  group_by(taxon) %>% 
  mutate(
    color = if_else(longev_F > longev_M, "#3A8AD8", "#F2A039"),
    taxon_id = cur_group_id()
    ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  # Clean one of the taxon names that is misspelled
  mutate(taxon = if_else(taxon == "CMED", "CMEAD", taxon)) %>% 
  # Merge aggregated data with the taxonomy to obtain species names
  left_join(taxonomy)
```
<br>


Let's store the names of the font families in two variables

```{r}
family1 = "Fira Sans Compressed"
family2 = "Faune"
```
<br>

# Basic parallel plot
***

Let's get started by plotting a very simple parallel plot. 
This plot is made of two components: segments and points.

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=11, dpi=320, out.width="70%"}
plt <- ggplot(lem_longev) + 
  geom_segment(aes(y = longev_F, yend = longev_M, x = 1, xend = 2, color = color)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = longev_F, x = 1, color = color, size = n_F)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = longev_M, x = 2, color = color, size = n_M)) +
  scale_color_identity()

plt
```
<br>

# Add labels
***

That was a pretty good start. Now it's time to add the labels for the species. 
This is when the chart gets really insightful because the labels allow us to 
identify each species and compare them. 

Fortunately, there's `ggrepel` which is going to make extremely easy to 
automatically adjust the position of the labels. 

Let's do it!

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=11, dpi=320, out.width="70%"}
plt <- plt +
  geom_text_repel(
    data = subset(lem_longev, taxon_id %% 2 != 0),
    aes(y = longev_M, x = 2, label = latin_name),
    nudge_x = 0.1, hjust = 0, direction = "y", family = family1,
    point.padding = 1, segment.size = 0.2, color = "grey15"
  ) +
  geom_text_repel(
    data = subset(lem_longev, taxon_id %% 2 == 0),
    aes(y = longev_F, x = 1, label = latin_name),
    nudge_x = -0.1, hjust = 1, direction = "y", family = family1,
    point.padding = 1, segment.size = 0.2, color = "grey15"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.5, 2.5))

plt
```
<br>

It's worth remarking some arguments in the `geom_text_repel()` function.
First, `direction = "y"`. This tells the text can only be 
shifted in the vertical direction, which ensures the labels are horizontally 
aligned. Then we also have `nudge_x`, which adjust where the text starts
horizontally, and `hjust` that determines if the text is left aligned (`hjust=0`)
or right aligned (`hjust=1`).
 

# Clean and customize layout
***

The next step is to add some annotations. First, horizontal lines and labels to 
indicate the ages on the vertical axis. Then, other labels on the sides telling 
which side represents which sex.

This step is also about customizing the legend. This legend is going to tell 
what is being represented by the dot sizes. 

Finally, the following chunk also changes the background color and removes the 
tick marks from both axis.

Notice the plot is built from scratch again. This is because `ggplot2` 
uses something known as the _painter model_, which means that elements are
drawn in the same order they are included in the plot. In other words, if you
want some labels to be placed behind the segments, you need to add them earlier,
as follows:

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=11, dpi=320, out.width="70%"}
plt <- ggplot(lem_longev) + 
  # Add horizontal lines in the bacground representing the years axis
  annotate(
    "segment", x = 1.1, xend = 1.9, 
    y = seq(10, 40, by = 1), yend = seq(10, 40, by = 1), 
    alpha = 0.2, size = 0.2
  ) +
  # Add points with the same color than the background. These are the 
  # background of the text indicating the ages
  annotate(
    "point", x = 1.5, y = seq(10, 40, by = 5), 
    size = 16, color = "grey96"
  ) +
  # Add the ages
  annotate(
    "text", x = 1.5, y = seq(10, 40, by = 5), 
    label = seq(10, 40, by = 5), size = 8, alpha = 0.2, 
    family = family2, fontface = "bold", color = "darkgreen"
  ) +
  # Add annotation indicating which sex is on each side
  annotate(
    "text", x = c(0.9, 2.1), y = 11.25, 
    label = c("Female", "Male"), hjust = c(1, 0), family = family2, 
    fontface = "bold", size = 10, alpha = 0.3, color = "darkgreen"
  ) +
  # Same lollipops as above
  geom_segment(aes(y = longev_F, yend = longev_M, x = 1, xend = 2, color = color)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = longev_F, x = 1, color = color, size = n_F)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = longev_M, x = 2, color = color, size = n_M)) +
  
  # Same labels as above
  geom_text_repel(
    data = subset(lem_longev, taxon_id %% 2 != 0),
    aes(y = longev_M, x = 2, label = latin_name),
    nudge_x = 0.1, hjust = 0, direction = "y", family = family1,
    point.padding = 1, segment.size = 0.2, color = "grey15"
  ) +
  geom_text_repel(
    data = subset(lem_longev, taxon_id %% 2 == 0),
    aes(y = longev_F, x = 1, label = latin_name),
    nudge_x = -0.1, hjust = 1, direction = "y", family = family1,
    point.padding = 1, segment.size = 0.2, color = "grey15"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0.5, 2.5)) +
  scale_color_identity() +
  # This scale determine how the legend for the size is created
  scale_size_continuous(
    range = c(0.5, 5), 
    breaks = seq(0, 120, by = 20), 
    name = "Total number of lemurs hosted at DLC by species and sex"
  ) +
  # Use a completely empty theme
  theme_void() +
  # Build a theme from scratch
  theme(
    # Set background color to grey96
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "grey96", color = NA),
    # Send legend to bottom
    legend.position = "bottom",
    # Customize text of individual elements in the legend
    legend.text = element_text(family = family1, color = "darkgreen"),
    # Customize text of the legend title
    legend.title = element_text(family = family1, color = "darkgreen"),
    # Customize margin, the 10 is added to the top of the legend.
    legend.margin = margin(10, 0, 0, 0)
  )
  
plt
```

# Final chart
***

The chart above is just one step away from being publication-ready. This final 
touch consists of adding a good title and a subtitle to clearly describe what 
you see in the chart, and a caption giving appropriate credit to the author of 
the visualization and the people who made the data available. 


```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=11, dpi=320, out.width="70%"}
plt <- plt + 
  labs(
    title = "Longest lived lemurs at the Duke Lemur Center",
    subtitle = "Maximum age recorded in years (living or dead), by species and sex",
    caption = "Source: Duke Lemur Center ¬∑ Graphic: Georgios Karamanis"
  ) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(
      hjust = 0.5, size = 28, family = family2, 
      face = "bold", color = "darkgreen"
    ),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(
      margin = margin(7, 0, 0, 0), hjust = 0.5, 
      size = 18, family = family1, color = "grey30"
    ),
    plot.caption = element_text(
      hjust = 0.5, size = 10, color = "grey30", family = family1
    ),
    plot.margin = margin(20, 20, 20, 20)
  )

plt
```
