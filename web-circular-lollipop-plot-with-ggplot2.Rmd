# About
***

This page showcases the work of [C√©dric Scherer](https://www.cedricscherer.com), 
built for the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) 
initiative. You can find the original code on his Github repository [here](https://github.com/z3tt/TidyTuesday/blob/master/R/2020_03_Passwords.Rmd).

Thanks to him for accepting sharing his work here! Thanks also to 
[Tom√°s Capretto](https://tcapretto.netlify.app/) who split the original code 
into this step-by-step guide! üôèüôè

As a teaser, here is the plot we‚Äôre gonna try building:

# Load packages
***

Let‚Äôs start by loading the packages needed to build the figure. 
[`ggtext`](https://wilkelab.org/ggtext/), and [`patchwork`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/index.html) 
stand out today. `ggtext` makes it very easy to style text with Markdown
or HTML, and `patchwork` allows us to compose ggplot2 figures very smoothly.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggtext)
library(patchwork)
```
<br>

Today, the plot is going to be based on the **Roboto Mono** font family. 
If you are unsure about how to work with custom fonts in `R`, 
[this post](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/custom-fonts-in-R-and-ggplot2) is 
for you.

# Load and prepare the data
***

This guide shows how to create a beautiful multipanel circular lollipop plot to
visualize password popularity and strengths.

The data for this post comes from [Information is Beautiful](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cz7TDhm0ebVpySqbTvrHrD3WpxeyE4hLZtifWSnoNTQ/edit#gid=21). 
This guide uses the dataset released for the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) 
initiative on the week of 2020-01-14. You can find the original announcement and
more information about the data [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-01-14). 
Thank you all for making this guide possible!

Let's start by loading the dataset:

```{r}
df_pw <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-01-14/passwords.csv') %>% 
  # Remove rows where the password is missing
  filter(!is.na(password))
```
<br>

From all the columns in the data frame, only `rank`, `password`, `category`, 
`value`, and `time_unit` are going to be used. Let's see what they mean:

- `rank` Popularity in the database of released passwords
- `password` The text of the password
- `category`The category where the password falls into
- `value` Time to crack by online guessing
- `time_unit` Time unit to match with value


The next step is to convert all the time values to a common unit such as seconds.
This task suits very well for the `case_when()` function.

```{r}
df_pw_time <- 
  df_pw %>% 
  mutate(
    time = case_when(
      time_unit == "seconds" ~ value,
      time_unit == "minutes" ~ value * 60,
      time_unit == "hours" ~ value * 60 * 60,
      time_unit == "days" ~ value * 60 * 24,
      time_unit == "weeks" ~ value * 60 * 24 * 7,
      time_unit == "months" ~ value * 60 * 24 * 30,
      time_unit == "years" ~ value * 60 * 24 * 365,
      TRUE ~ NA_real_
    )
  ) 
```
<br>

Next, a fixed value of 1000 is added to all the times. This is going to leave 
the extra space needed for the labels within the circle.

```{r}
plus <- 1000
df_pw_plot <-
  df_pw_time %>% 
  mutate(time = time + plus) %>% 
  add_row(rank = 501, time = 1)
```
<br>

And finally, create a data frame with all the information required
to place labels for passwords that were really hard to crack.

```{r}
labels <-
  df_pw_plot %>% 
  # Value > 90 selects those above 90 years!
  filter(value > 90) %>% 
  # Create label out of the password and its rank
  mutate(label = glue::glue("<b>{password}</b><br><span style='font-size:18pt'>Rank: {rank}</span>")) %>% 
  # These columns give the position of the labels
  add_column(
    x = c(33, 332, 401, 492),
    y = c(75000000, 90000000, 45000000, 48498112)
  )
```
<br>

Did you note that HTML within the label string? That is one of the many ways
to tell `ggtext` how to customize the text in the plot. That library is great!


# Basic circular plot
***

Let's start by creating the circular plot on the top panel:

```{r, fig.width = 30, fig.height=27.35, out.width="95%", fig.align="center"}
main <- ggplot(df_pw_plot, aes(rank, time, color = category)) +
  # This segment represents the vertical lines
  geom_segment(
    aes(x = rank, xend = rank, y = 0, yend = time), 
    size = 1.2
  ) +
  # This rect is converted into the inner circle where we're going to place text
  # when converting the plot to circular coordinates.
  geom_rect(
    aes(xmin = 1, xmax = 501, ymin = 0, ymax = plus), 
    fill = "grey97", color = "grey97"
  ) + 
  
  # Add our custom grid lines for the radial axis.
  # These lines indicate one day, one week, one month and one year.
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = (1 * 24 * 60 + plus)), color = "grey88") +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = (7 * 24 * 60 + plus)), color = "grey85") +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = (30 * 24 * 60 + plus)), color = "grey82") +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = (365 * 24 * 60 + plus)), color = "grey79") +
  
  # Add points on the end of each line
  geom_point(aes(size = time)) +
  
  # Polar axis (y-axis) is in log10 scale
  scale_y_log10(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  
  # Use the Prism color scale for the categories
  rcartocolor::scale_color_carto_d(palette = "Prism", guide = "none") +
  
  # Assign a range for the size of the dots
  scale_size(
    range = c(1, 8), 
    limits = c(plus, max(df_pw_plot$time)), 
    guide = "none"
  ) +
  
  # Make it circular!
  coord_polar() 

main
```
<br>

Converting a plot from cartesian to circular (polar) coordinates in `ggplot2` 
is as easy as adding a `coord_polar()` call to the plot. So neat!

# Add text annotations
***

The plot obtained so far looks quite nice, but it's not done. It still lacks 
something that indicates how to read the story this chart is trying to tell and
the labels that highlight those very hard to crack passwords. Let's do it!

```{r, fig.width = 30, fig.height=27.35, out.width="95%", fig.align="center"}
main <- main + 
  # Add labels with `geom_richtext()`
  geom_richtext(
    data = labels,
    aes(x = x, y = y, label = label, color = category),
    lineheight = 0.8,
    size = 8,
    family = "Roboto Mono",
    label.color = NA
  ) +
  # Regular text with `geom_text()`
  # Note that coordinates are explicitly passed here.
  geom_text(
    x = 500, y = 1.2,
    label = "********\nCracking\nYour Favorite\nPassword",
    family = "Roboto Mono Medium",
    size = 20,
    lineheight = 0.87,
    color = "grey60"
  ) +
  geom_text(
    x = 250, y = 0.25,
    label = "********",
    family = "Roboto Mono Medium",
    size = 20,
    lineheight = 0.87,
    color = "grey60"
  ) +
  geom_text(
    x = 250, y = 1.1,
    label = "Time it takes to crack the 500 most\ncommon passwords by online guessing.\nSorted by rank and colored by category.",
    family = "Roboto Mono",
    size = 7,
    lineheight = 0.87,
    color = "grey73"
  ) +
  geom_text(
    x = 250, y = 1.95,
    label = "Time is displayed on a logarithmic scale\nwith the rings representing one day,\none week, one month, and one year\n(from inner to outer ring).",
    family = "Roboto Mono",
    size = 6,
    lineheight = 0.87,
    color = "grey73"
  )
  
main
```
<br>

`geom_richtext()` is kind of magical. Just give it got some text formatted 
with HTML and it takes care of everything needed to succesfully protray the 
formatted label in the figure.

So far, this is enough for the top-panel figure. Further modifications such as 
a different background color and margin adjustments are going to happen when 
this plot is composed with the lower-panel figures.


# Multi panel plot
***

The original plot we're trying to replicate consists of several panels and all 
the work above only replicates the bigger panel on top. The good news is that 
`ggplot2` makes it really easy to reuse existing code for a plot and convert it
into a plot made of multiple panels. 


First of all, it's necessary to add line breaks to some existing category names
so they fit within the inner circle.

```{r}
facet_data <- 
  df_pw_plot %>% 
  add_row(rank = 501, time = 1, category = unique(df_pw_plot$category)) %>% 
  # This is where we add line breaks
  mutate(
    cat_label = case_when(
      category == "cool-macho" ~ "cool-\nmacho",
      category == "nerdy-pop" ~ "nerdy-\npop",
      category == "password-related" ~ "password-\nrelated",
      category == "rebellious-rude" ~ "rebel-\nlious-\nrude",
      category == "simple-alphanumeric" ~ "simple-\nalpha-\nnumeric",
      TRUE ~ category
    )
  ) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(category))
```
<br>

And now let's make the plot!

```{r, fig.width=30, fig.height=7.65, out.width="95%", fig.align="center"}
# Much of the code is the same than the code above.

facet <- ggplot(facet_data, aes(rank, time, color = category)) +
  geom_segment(
    aes(x = rank, xend = rank, y = 0, yend = time), 
    size = 0.6
  ) +
  geom_rect(
    aes(xmin = 1, xmax = 501, ymin = 0, ymax = plus), 
    fill = "grey97", color = "grey97"
  ) + 
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = (1 * 24 * 60 + plus)), color = "grey82", size = 0.2) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = (7 * 24 * 60 + plus)), color = "grey79", size = 0.2) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = (30 * 24 * 60 + plus)), color = "grey76", size = 0.2) +
  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = (365 * 24 * 60 + plus)), color = "grey73", size = 0.2) +
  geom_point(aes(size = time)) +
  
  # This is what adds the label within each circle
  geom_text(
    aes(label = cat_label, color = category),
    x = 500, y = 0,
    family = "Roboto Mono Medium",
    size = 8,
    lineheight = 0.87
  ) +
  # This is what wraps the panels for the categories into a layout of 2 rows
  facet_wrap(~ category, nrow = 2) +
  coord_polar() + 
  scale_y_log10(expand = c(0, 0)) + 
  rcartocolor::scale_color_carto_d(palette = "Prism", guide = "none") +
  scale_size(
    range = c(0.5, 7), 
    limits = c(plus, max(df_pw_plot$time)), 
    guide = "none"
  ) + 
  theme(
    strip.text = element_blank(), 
  )
  
facet
```
<br>

Did you spot the difference in the code? Just adding 
`facet_wrap(~ category, nrow = 2)` tells `ggplot2` to create a plot for each 
level in the `category` variable and arrange them in a 2-row layout.

# Final chart
***

The two plots obtained above can be composed very easily into a single figure 
thanks to the `patchwork` package. At this stage, it is also important to 
adjust the margins and the space between the panels to obtain a better appearece.
Are you ready to finish? Let's go!


```{r, fig.width=30, fig.height=35, out.width="95%", fig.align="center"}
# Customize the main panel (top-panel)
main <- main + 
  # This 'theme_void' adds a completely empty theme 
  theme_void() + 
  # These negative margins are VERY important to obtain a tight layout.
  theme(
    plot.margin = margin(-50, -180, -70, -180, "lines"),
  )

facet <- facet + 
  # Same theme_void for the lower panels
  theme_void() +
  theme(
    # Negative spacing between panels, which means they overlap
    panel.spacing = unit(-8, "lines"),
    # Negative margin on top, to decrease blank space between these panels
    # and the main plot on top
    plot.margin = margin(-40, 50, 10, 50)
  ) + 
  # Adjust settings for the caption
  theme(
    plot.caption = element_text(
      family = "Roboto Mono Medium", 
      size = 20, 
      color = "grey60", 
      hjust = 0.5, 
      margin = margin(-50, 10, 30, 10)
    )
  ) + 
  # Add caption
  labs(caption = "Visualization by C√©dric Scherer ‚àô Data by Knowledge is Beautiful")


# Combine the two plots
# The '+' means to 'add' the two ggplot2 plots together.
panel <- (main + facet) + 
  plot_layout(
    ncol = 1, # Results in one plot on top and another on the bottom.
    heights = c(1, 0.28) # Height assigned to each plot
  )
panel
```

Awesome, we nailed it!!ü•≥
