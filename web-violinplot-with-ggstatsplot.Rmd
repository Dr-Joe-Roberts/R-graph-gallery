# About
***

This page showcases the work of [Tuo Wang](https://tuowang.rbind.io/) that 
introduces packages to make [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) plots 
more beautiful. You can find the original code on Tuo's blog 
[here](https://tuowang.rbind.io/post/2021-03-25-ggplot2-extensions/).

Thanks to him for accepting sharing his work here! Thanks also to 
[Tom√°s Capretto](https://tcapretto.netlify.app/) who split the original code 
into this step-by-step guide!

## Load packages
***

Let's start by loading the packages needed to build the figure. 
[ggstatsplot](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/) is the showcased 
package today. `ggstatsplot` is an extension of ggplot2 package for creating 
graphics with details from statistical tests included in the information-rich 
plots themselves.

```{r}
library(ggstatsplot)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
```

<br>

# Load and prepare the dataset
***

Today's data were collected and made available by 
[Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) 
and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/), a member of 
the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/). This dataset 
was popularized by [Allison Horst](https://www.allisonhorst.com/) in her R 
package [`palmerpenguins`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) with 
the goal to offer an alternative to the iris dataset for data exploration and 
visualization.

```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

<br>

The only data preparation step is to simply drop missing values.

```{r}
penguins <- drop_na(penguins)
```

<br>

## Basic chart
***

Today's chart is going to show the distribution of Bill length for the three
species of penguins in the dataset (Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo). The function
`ggbetweenstats` in the `ggstatsplot` is a great fit for this goal. Let's see
how it works. 

```{r}
plt <- ggbetweenstats(
  data = penguins,
  x = species,
  y = bill_length_mm
)
```
  
```{r, include=FALSE}
ggsave(
  filename = here::here("img", "fromTheWeb", "web-violinplot-with-ggstatsplot-preview1.png"),
  plot = plt
)
```

<center>
![](img/fromTheWeb/web-violinplot-with-ggstatsplot-preview1.png){width=80%}
</center>

It's hard to find where the *basic* word fits in such a beautiful default plot,
isn't it? 

## Add title and labels

`ggstatsplot` has very nice defaults that save a lot of time and work. But it 
can't take over every single aspect of our charts. This is a good moment to add 
an appropriate title and labels with nice-looking styles.

```{r}
plt <- plt + 
  # Add labels and title
  labs(
    x = "Penguins Species",
    y = "Bill Length",
    title = "Distribution of bill length across penguins species"
  ) + 
  # Customizations
  theme(
    # This is the new default font in the plot
    text = element_text(family = "Roboto", size = 8, color = "black"),
    plot.title = element_text(
      family = "Lobster Two", 
      size = 20,
      face = "bold",
      color = "#2a475e"
    ),
    # Statistical annotations below the main title
    plot.subtitle = element_text(
      family = "Roboto", 
      size = 15, 
      face = "bold",
      color="#1b2838"
    ),
    plot.title.position = "plot", # slightly different from default
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10, color = "black"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 12)
  )
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
ggsave(
  filename = here::here("img", "fromTheWeb", "web-violinplot-with-ggstatsplot-preview2.png"),
  plot = plt,
  width = 8,
  height = 8,
  device = "png"
)
```

</center>

Much better!

## Final chart
***
  
The chart above is pretty close to being publication-ready. It only needs some 
final touches to the layout and it's ready to go.

```{r}
# 1. Remove axis ticks
# 2. Change default color of the axis lines with a lighter one
# 3. Remove most reference lines, only keep the major horizontal ones.
#    This reduces clutter, while keeping the reference for the variable
#    being compared.
# 4. Set the panel and the background fill to the same light color.

plt <- plt  +
  theme(
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.line = element_line(colour = "grey50"),
    panel.grid = element_line(color = "#b4aea9"),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(linetype = "dashed"),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#fbf9f4", color = "#fbf9f4"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#fbf9f4", color = "#fbf9f4")
  )
```

<br>

And finally, save the result. Check it out! Isn't it wonderful?

```{r}
ggsave(
  filename = here::here("img", "fromTheWeb", "web-violinplot-with-ggstatsplot.png"),
  plot = plt,
  width = 8,
  height = 8,
  device = "png"
)
```
