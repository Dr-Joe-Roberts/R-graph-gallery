# About
***

This page showcases the work by the data visualization team at 
[The Economist](https://www.economist.com/). You can find the original chart in 
[this article](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/08/23/the-number-of-child-labourers-has-increased-for-the-first-time-in-20-years).

Thanks to them for all the inspiring and insightful visualizations! Thanks also
to [Tom√°s Capretto](https://tcapretto.netlify.app/) who replicated the chart 
in R! üôèüôè

As a teaser, here is the plot we‚Äôre gonna try building:

It is possible to think it is not going to be too much work to reproduce today's
chart because, at first sight, there's nothing that looks very fancy. 
However, it actually contains several subtle customizations that when added all 
together make the final result look original and beautiful. 

This is article uses several plotting libraries. The first one is
[`shadowtext`](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/shadowtext),
a library that allows to draw text with shadows. Then, the popular 
[`patchwork`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/), which is going to make the
task of combining `ggplot2` figures extremely easy. And finally, we're also
going to use the `grid` library, the drawing library behind the excellent 
`ggplot2` package that we always use. 

In addition, other utilities libraries are used: 
[`ggtext`](https://wilkelab.org/ggtext/) to draw text with multiple styles very
easily, and [`ggnewscale`](https://eliocamp.github.io/ggnewscale/) to use
multiple color scales in the same `ggplot2` plot.


```{r}
library(grid)
library(ggnewscale)
library(ggtext)
library(tidyverse)
library(shadowtext)
library(patchwork)

# Create data
***

The chart we're going to reproduce today is made of two separated plots, a 
[line chart](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/line-plot.html) and a 
[stacked area chart](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/stacked-area-graph.html). 
These charts use different datasets that are created below:

```{r}
# First, define colors.
BROWN <- "#AD8C97"
BROWN_DARKER <- "#7d3a46"
GREEN <- "#2FC1D3"
BLUE <- "#076FA1"
GREY <- "#C7C9CB"
GREY_DARKER <- "#5C5B5D"
RED <- "#E3120B"
```
<br>

The dataset for the line chart:

```{r}
regions <- c(
  "Sub-Saharan Africa", 
  "Asia and the Pacific", 
  "Latin America and the Caribbean"
)

line_data <- data.frame(
  year = rep(c(2008, 2012, 2016, 2020), 3),
  percent = c(25.5, 21, 22.2, 24, 13.5, 9.5, 7.5, 5.5,10, 9, 7.5, 5.8),
  region = factor(rep(regions, each = 4), levels = regions)
)

line_labels<- data.frame(
  labels = c("Sub-Saharan Africa", "Asia and the Pacific", "Latin America and\nthe Caribbean"),
  x = c(2007.9, 2010, 2007.9),
  y = c(27, 13, 5.8),
  color = c(BLUE, GREEN, BROWN_DARKER)
)
```
<br>

And the dataset for the stacked area chart:

```{r}
regions <- c(
  "Sub-Saharan Africa", 
  "Asia and the Pacific", 
  "Latin America and the Caribbean", 
  "Rest of world"
)

stacked_data <- data.frame(
  year = rep(c(2008, 2012, 2016, 2020), 4),
  percent = c(65, 55, 67, 85, 130, 85, 65, 50, 10, 10, 10, 8, 60, 20, 10, 16),
  region = factor(rep(regions, each = 4), levels = rev(regions))
)

stacked_labels <- data.frame(
  labels = c(
    "Sub-Saharan Africa", 
    "Asia and the Pacific", 
    "Latin America and\nthe Caribbean",
    "Rest\nof world"
  ),
  x = c(2014, 2014, 2014, 2008.1),
  y = c(25, 100, 225, 225),
  color = c("white", "white", BROWN_DARKER, GREY_DARKER)
)
```
<br>

Note these values are inferred from the original plot and not something computed
from the original data source.

# Basic linechart
***

Let's get started by creating the line chart first. This is a line chart that
has dots drawn on top of it. In `ggplot2` this is as easy as adding a call to
`geom_point()` after `geom_line()` to ensure the dots are on top of the lines.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, dpi=300, out.width="70%"}
# Aesthetics defined in the `ggplot()` call are reused in the 
# `geom_line()` and `geom_point()` calls.
plt1 <- ggplot(line_data, aes(year, percent)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = region), size = 2.4) +
  geom_point(
    aes(fill = region), 
    size = 5, 
    pch = 21, # Type of point that allows us to have both color (border) and fill.
    color = "white", 
    stroke = 1 # The width of the border, i.e. stroke.
  ) +
  # Set values for the color and the fill
  scale_color_manual(values = c(BLUE, GREEN, BROWN)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(BLUE, GREEN, BROWN)) + 
  # Do not include any legend
  theme(legend.position = "none")

plt1
```
<br>

It's been a fair start so far! There's still lot to do! Let's continue with 
some layout customizations.

# Customize layout
***

The next step is to customize the layout: change colors, modify axis labels, add
grid lines, and many more exciting changes! Let's do it!


```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, dpi=300, out.width="70%"}
plt1 <- plt1 + 
  scale_x_continuous(
    limits = c(2007.5, 2021.5),
    expand = c(0, 0), # The horizontal axis does not extend to either side
    breaks = c(2008, 2012, 2016, 2020),  # Set custom break locations
    labels = c("2008", "12", "16", "20") # And custom labels on those breaks!
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(0, 32),
    breaks = seq(0, 30, by = 5), 
    expand = c(0, 0)
  ) + 
  theme(
    # Set background color to white
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
    # Remove all grid lines
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    # But add grid lines for the vertical axis, customizing color and size 
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "#A8BAC4", size = 0.3),
    # Remove tick marks on the vertical axis by setting their length to 0
    axis.ticks.length.y = unit(0, "mm"), 
    # But keep tick marks on horizontal axis
    axis.ticks.length.x = unit(2, "mm"),
    # Remove the title for both axes
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    # Only the bottom line of the vertical axis is painted in black
    axis.line.x.bottom = element_line(color = "black"),
    # Remove labels from the vertical axis
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    # But customize labels for the horizontal axis
    axis.text.x = element_text(family = "Econ Sans Cnd", size = 16)
  )

plt1
```
<br>

It definitely starts to look very nice! ü§©

# Add annotations and title
***

The chart doesn't still indicate anything about the regions represented by each
line, or the meaning of the vertical axis. It cannot be left like that. 
This is a good time to improve that!

The following chunk uses both `geom_text()` and `geom_shadowtext()`. The first
one is used to draw regular text to indicate the values of the horizontal grid 
lines that serve as a reference. On the other hand, `geom_shadowtext()` is used
to add the labels for the lines. The shadow added covers the horizontal line 
behind the label for Latin America and the Caribbean region. 

In addition, `new_scale_color()` is used to add a new color scale, the one
used for the region labels. Although the colors are the same than those added
above, `geom_shadowtext()` uses a different data set and thus is considered
a new color scale.

Finally, the last step is to add a proper title. Note this title mixes bold and 
regular text, which is very easy thanks to the `ggtext` package.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, dpi=300, out.width="70%"}

# Add labels for the lines
plt1 <- plt1 + 
  new_scale_color() + 
  geom_shadowtext(
    aes(x, y, label = labels, color = color),
    data = line_labels,
    hjust = 0, # Align to the left
    bg.colour = "white", # Shadow color (or background color)
    bg.r = 0.4, # Radius of the background. The higher the value the bigger the shadow.
    family = "Econ Sans Cnd",
    size = 6
  ) + 
  scale_color_identity() # Use the colors in the 'color' variable as they are.

# Add labels for the horizontal lines
plt1 <- plt1 + 
  geom_text(
    data = data.frame(x = 2021.5, y = seq(0, 30, by = 5)),
    aes(x, y, label = y),
    hjust = 1, # Align to the right
    vjust = 0, # Align to the bottom
    nudge_y = 32 * 0.01, # The pad is equal to 1% of the vertical range (32 - 0)
    family = "Econ Sans Cnd",
    size = 6
  )

# Add title
plt1 <- plt1 +
  labs(
    title = "**Selected regions,** % of child population",
  ) + 
  theme(
    # theme_markdown() is provided by ggtext and means the title contains 
    # Markdown that should be parsed as such (the '**' symbols)
    plot.title = element_markdown(
      family = "Econ Sans Cnd", 
      size = 18
    )
  )

plt1
```
<br>


# Stacked area chart
***

Thanks to the `geom_area()` function, it is quite straightforward to create a 
[stacked area chart](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/stacked-area-graph.html) 
in `ggplot2`. 

```{r}
plt2 <- ggplot(stacked_data) +
  geom_area(aes(year, percent, fill = region), color = "white") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(GREY, BROWN, GREEN, BLUE)) +
  theme(legend.position = "None")

plt2
```

# Customize layout

    axis.ticks.length.x = unit(2, "mm"),
    # Remove the title for both axes
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    # Only bottom line of the vertical axis is painted in black
    axis.line.x.bottom = element_line(color = "black"),
    # Remove labels from the vertical axis
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),

# The extra mile
***

If you are attentive to the smallest of the details you may have noticed the 
titles in the chart above aren't aligned exactly in the same way than the titles
in the original chart. 

By default, `ggplot2` aligns titles using the panel region as 
reference. We asked ggplot2 to use the plot region as reference when we added
`plot.title.position = "plot"` in the `theme()` call. But it was not enought.
The title is not completely aligned to the left border of the chart, which
you can notice by comparing the position of the rectangle on top with the titles.

This extra step consists of removing the titles generated with `ggplot2` and
replacing them with text drawn with the `grix.text()` function.
