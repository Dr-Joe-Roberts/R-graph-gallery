# About
***

This page showcases the work by the data visualization team at 
[The Economist](https://www.economist.com/). You can find the original chart in 
[this article](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/08/23/the-number-of-child-labourers-has-increased-for-the-first-time-in-20-years).

Thanks to them for all the inspiring and insightful visualizations! Thanks also
to [Tom√°s Capretto](https://tcapretto.netlify.app/) who replicated the chart 
in R! üôèüôè

As a teaser, here is the plot we‚Äôre gonna try building:

It is possible to think it is not going to be too much work to reproduce today's
chart because, at first sight, there's nothing that looks very fancy. 
However, it actually contains several subtle customizations that when added all 
together make the final result look original and beautiful. 

This is article uses several plotting libraries apart from the nice `ggplot2` 
we always use. The first one is [`shadowtext`](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/shadowtext),
a library that allows to draw text with shadows. Then, the popular 
[`patchwork`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/), which is going to make the
task of combining `ggplot2` figures extremely easy. And finally, we're also
going to use the `grid` library, the drawing library behind `ggplot2`.

In addition, other utilities libraries are used: 
[`ggtext`](https://wilkelab.org/ggtext/) to draw text with multiple styles very
easily, and [`ggnewscale`](https://eliocamp.github.io/ggnewscale/) to use
multiple color scales in the same `ggplot2` plot.


```{r}
library(grid)
library(ggnewscale)
library(ggtext)
library(tidyverse)
library(shadowtext)
library(patchwork)
```

# Create data
***

The chart we're going to reproduce today is made of two separated plots, a 
[line chart](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/line-plot.html) and a 
[stacked area chart](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/stacked-area-graph.html). 
These charts use different datasets that are created below:

```{r}
# First, define colors.
BROWN <- "#AD8C97"
BROWN_DARKER <- "#7d3a46"
GREEN <- "#2FC1D3"
BLUE <- "#076FA1"
GREY <- "#C7C9CB"
GREY_DARKER <- "#5C5B5D"
RED <- "#E3120B"
```
<br>

The dataset for the line chart:

```{r}
regions <- c(
  "Sub-Saharan Africa", 
  "Asia and the Pacific", 
  "Latin America and the Caribbean"
)

line_data <- data.frame(
  year = rep(c(2008, 2012, 2016, 2020), 3),
  percent = c(25.5, 21, 22.2, 24, 13.5, 9.5, 7.5, 5.5,10, 9, 7.5, 5.8),
  region = factor(rep(regions, each = 4), levels = regions)
)

line_labels<- data.frame(
  labels = c("Sub-Saharan Africa", "Asia and the Pacific", "Latin America and\nthe Caribbean"),
  x = c(2007.9, 2010, 2007.9),
  y = c(27, 13, 5.8),
  color = c(BLUE, GREEN, BROWN_DARKER)
)
```
<br>

And the dataset for the stacked area chart:

```{r}
regions <- c(
  "Sub-Saharan Africa", 
  "Asia and the Pacific", 
  "Latin America and the Caribbean", 
  "Rest of world"
)

stacked_data <- data.frame(
  year = rep(c(2008, 2012, 2016, 2020), 4),
  percent = c(65, 55, 67, 85, 130, 85, 65, 50, 10, 10, 10, 8, 60, 20, 10, 16),
  region = factor(rep(regions, each = 4), levels = rev(regions))
)

stacked_labels <- data.frame(
  labels = c(
    "Sub-Saharan Africa", 
    "Asia and the Pacific", 
    "Latin America and\nthe Caribbean",
    "Rest\nof world"
  ),
  x = c(2014, 2014, 2014, 2008.1),
  y = c(25, 100, 225, 225),
  color = c("white", "white", BROWN_DARKER, GREY_DARKER)
)
```
<br>

Note the values in the data frames are inferred from the original plot and not 
something computed from the original data source.

# Basic linechart
***

Let's get started by creating the line chart first. This is a line chart that
has dots drawn on top of it. In `ggplot2` this is as easy as adding a call to
`geom_point()` after `geom_line()` to ensure the dots are on top of the lines.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, dpi=300, out.width="70%"}
# Aesthetics defined in the `ggplot()` call are reused in the 
# `geom_line()` and `geom_point()` calls.
plt1 <- ggplot(line_data, aes(year, percent)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = region), size = 2.4) +
  geom_point(
    aes(fill = region), 
    size = 5, 
    pch = 21, # Type of point that allows us to have both color (border) and fill.
    color = "white", 
    stroke = 1 # The width of the border, i.e. stroke.
  ) +
  # Set values for the color and the fill
  scale_color_manual(values = c(BLUE, GREEN, BROWN)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(BLUE, GREEN, BROWN)) + 
  # Do not include any legend
  theme(legend.position = "none")

plt1
```
<br>

It's been a fair start so far, but there's still lot to do! Let's continue with 
some layout customizations.

# Customize layout
***

The next step is to customize the layout: change colors, modify axis labels, add
grid lines, and many more exciting changes! Let's do it!


```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, dpi=300, out.width="70%"}
plt1 <- plt1 + 
  scale_x_continuous(
    limits = c(2007.5, 2021.5),
    expand = c(0, 0), # The horizontal axis does not extend to either side
    breaks = c(2008, 2012, 2016, 2020),  # Set custom break locations
    labels = c("2008", "12", "16", "20") # And custom labels on those breaks!
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(0, 32),
    breaks = seq(0, 30, by = 5), 
    expand = c(0, 0)
  ) + 
  theme(
    # Set background color to white
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
    # Remove all grid lines
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    # But add grid lines for the vertical axis, customizing color and size 
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "#A8BAC4", size = 0.3),
    # Remove tick marks on the vertical axis by setting their length to 0
    axis.ticks.length.y = unit(0, "mm"), 
    # But keep tick marks on horizontal axis
    axis.ticks.length.x = unit(2, "mm"),
    # Remove the title for both axes
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    # Only the bottom line of the vertical axis is painted in black
    axis.line.x.bottom = element_line(color = "black"),
    # Remove labels from the vertical axis
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    # But customize labels for the horizontal axis
    axis.text.x = element_text(family = "Econ Sans Cnd", size = 16)
  )

plt1
```
<br>

It definitely starts to look very nice! ü§©

# Add annotations and title
***

The chart doesn't still indicate anything about the regions represented by each
line, or the meaning of the vertical axis. It cannot be left like that. 
This is a good time to improve that!

The following chunk uses both `geom_text()` and `geom_shadowtext()`. The first
one is used to draw regular text to indicate the values of the horizontal grid 
lines that serve as a reference. On the other hand, `geom_shadowtext()` is used
to add the labels for the lines. The shadow added covers the horizontal line 
behind the label for Latin America and the Caribbean region. 

In addition, `new_scale_color()` is used to add a new color scale, the one
used for the region labels. Although the colors are the same than those added
above, `geom_shadowtext()` uses a different data set and thus is considered
a new color scale.

Finally, the last step is to add a proper title. Note this title mixes bold and 
regular text, which is very easy thanks to the `ggtext` package.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, dpi=300, out.width="70%"}

# Add labels for the lines
plt1 <- plt1 + 
  new_scale_color() + 
  geom_shadowtext(
    aes(x, y, label = labels, color = color),
    data = line_labels,
    hjust = 0, # Align to the left
    bg.colour = "white", # Shadow color (or background color)
    bg.r = 0.4, # Radius of the background. The higher the value the bigger the shadow.
    family = "Econ Sans Cnd",
    size = 6
  ) + 
  scale_color_identity() # Use the colors in the 'color' variable as they are.

# Add labels for the horizontal lines
plt1 <- plt1 + 
  geom_text(
    data = data.frame(x = 2021.5, y = seq(0, 30, by = 5)),
    aes(x, y, label = y),
    hjust = 1, # Align to the right
    vjust = 0, # Align to the bottom
    nudge_y = 32 * 0.01, # The pad is equal to 1% of the vertical range (32 - 0)
    family = "Econ Sans Cnd",
    size = 6
  )

# Add title
plt1 <- plt1 +
  labs(
    title = "**Selected regions,** % of child population",
  ) + 
  theme(
    # theme_markdown() is provided by ggtext and means the title contains 
    # Markdown that should be parsed as such (the '**' symbols)
    plot.title = element_markdown(
      family = "Econ Sans Cnd", 
      size = 18
    )
  )

plt1
```
<br>


# Stacked area chart
***

Thanks to the `geom_area()` function, it is quite straightforward to create a 
[stacked area chart](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/stacked-area-graph.html) 
in `ggplot2`. 

```{r}
plt2 <- ggplot(stacked_data) +
  # color = "white" indicates the color of the lines between the areas
  geom_area(aes(year, percent, fill = region), color = "white") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(GREY, BROWN, GREEN, BLUE)) +
  theme(legend.position = "None") # no legend

plt2
```
<br>

# Customize layout
***

As with the previous chart, there's also a lot to customize here! 

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, dpi=300, out.width="70%"}

plt2 <- plt2 + 
  scale_x_continuous(
    # Note: Data goes from 2008 to 2020. Extra space is added on the right
    # so there's room for the grid line labels ;)
    limits = c(2007.5, 2021.5),
    expand = c(0, 0),
    breaks = c(2008, 2012, 2016, 2020),
    labels = c("2008", "12", "16", "20")
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(0, 320),
    breaks = seq(0, 300, by = 50), 
    expand = c(0, 0)
  ) + 
  theme(
    # Set background color to white
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
    # Remove all grid lines
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    # But add grid lines for the vertical axis, customizing color and size 
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "#A8BAC4", size = 0.3),
    # Remove tick marks by setting their length to 0
    axis.ticks.length.y = unit(0, "mm"), 
    axis.ticks.length.x = unit(2, "mm"),
    # Remove the title for both axes
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    # Only bottom line of the vertical axis is painted in black
    axis.line.x.bottom = element_line(color = "black"),
    # Remove labels from the vertical axis
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    # But customize labels for the horizontal axis
    axis.text.x = element_text(family = "Econ Sans Cnd", size = 16)
  )

plt2
```
<br>


# Add labels and annotations
***

We're about to finish this chart. This last step, which may be the most 
convoluted step, consists of adding several labels and various annotations. 
Firs of all, the labels for the areas. Then, the labels for the horizontal 
gridlines. After that, we make use of the `geom_curve()` function to add
a curve that goes from the "Latin America and the Caribbean" label to the 
area it represents. And finally, it's time for a title.

Sounds like lot of work? Come on, it's not going to be that hard!

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, dpi=300, out.width="70%"}
plt2 <- plt2 + 
  geom_text(
    aes(x, y, label = labels, color = color),
    data = stacked_labels,
    hjust = 0,
    vjust = 0.5,
    family = "Econ Sans Cnd",
    size = 6,
    inherit.aes = FALSE
  ) + 
  scale_color_identity()

plt2 <- plt2 +
  geom_text(
    data = data.frame(x = 2021.5, y = seq(0, 300, by = 50)),
    aes(x, y, label = y),
    hjust = 1,
    vjust = 0,
    nudge_y = 300 * 0.01, # Again, the pad is equal to 1% of the vertical range.
    family = "Econ Sans Cnd",
    size = 6,
    inherit.aes = FALSE
  )

plt2 <- plt2 + 
  geom_curve(
    aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend),
    data = data.frame(x = 2016.9, y = 210, xend = 2018.8, yend = 138),
    curvature = -0.5,
    angle = 90
  ) +
  geom_point(
    aes(x, y), 
    data = data.frame(x = 2018.8, y = 138),
    color = "black"
  )

# Note again we use `element_markdown()` to render Markdown content
plt2 <- plt2 + 
  labs(
    title = "**Number of children,** m",
  ) + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_markdown(
      family = "Econ Sans Cnd", 
      size = 18
    )
  )

plt2
```
<br>

# Combine charts
***

Now it comes one of the most exciting steps: combining the charts! Thankfully,
it exists `patchwork` which makes it extremely easy to combine plots made with
`ggplot2`. 

The following chunk not only combines the charts, it also adjust their horizontal
margins so the result has some space between the charts as in the original
figure. 

Next, we add a title to the plot obtained with patchwork using 
`plot_annotation()` and a theme created for it.

```{r, fig.width=14, fig.height=7.2, dpi=300, out.width="90%"}
plt1 <- plt1 + theme(plot.margin = margin(0, 0.05, 0, 0, "npc"))
plt2 <- plt2 + theme(plot.margin = margin(0, 0, 0.05, 0, "npc"))
plt <- plt1 | plt2


title_theme <- theme(
  plot.title = element_text(
    family = "Econ Sans Cnd", 
    face = "bold",
    size = 22,
    margin = margin(0.8, 0, 0, 0, "npc")
  ),
  plot.subtitle = element_text(
    family = "Econ Sans Cnd",
    size = 20,
    margin = margin(0.4, 0, 0, 0, "npc")
  )
)

plt <- plt + plot_annotation(
    title = "All work, no play",
    subtitle = "Children in child labour*",
    theme = title_theme
  ) +
  theme(
    plot.margin = margin(0.075, 0, 0.1, 0, "npc"),
  )

plt
```
<br>

It's so satisfying to see we're so close! Let's make one last effort and finish
this chart!

# Add final annotations with the `grid` library
***

The chart above is quite a good replicate of the original figure, but it is 
clearly missing some small, but very important, details. These are the 
distinctive red marks on top, and the captions with information about the source
of the data and credit to the original author.

We're going to use the `grid` library for this last task. `grid` is a low-level 
plotting library that comes with any `R` installation by default and provides 
many plotting primitive functions. It is also the library that `ggplot2` uses to 
create the charts under the hood, and that's why we can combine them in the 
same chart. 

Using `grid` will give us full control of what is added and where it is added
to the plot. The downside, is that it requires us to write a considerable amount
of extra code.

```{r, fig.width=14, fig.height=7.2, dpi=300, out.width="90%"}
plt

# Add line on top of the chart
grid.lines(
  x = c(0, 1),
  y = 1,
  gp = gpar(col = "#e5001c", lwd = 4)
)

# Add rectangle on top-left
# lwd = 0 means the rectangle does not have an outer line
# 'just' gives the horizontal and vertical justification
grid.rect(
  x = 0,
  y = 1,
  width = 0.05,
  height = 0.025,
  just = c("left", "top"),
  gp = gpar(fill = "#e5001c", lwd = 0)
)
# Add first caption
grid.text(
  'Source: "Child Labour: Global estimates 2020, trends and the road forward", ILO and UNICEF', 
  x = 0.005, 
  y = 0.06, 
  just = c("left", "bottom"),
  gp = gpar(
    col = "grey50",
    fontsize = 16,
    fontfamily = "Econ Sans Cnd"
  )
)

# Add second caption
grid.text(
  "The Economist", 
  x = 0.005, 
  y = 0.005, 
  just = c("left", "bottom"),
  gp = gpar(
    col = "grey50",
    fontsize = 16,
    fontfamily = "Milo TE W01"
  )
)

# Add third caption
grid.text(
  "*5- to 17- year-olds", 
  x = 0.995, 
  y = 0.06, 
  just = c("right", "bottom"),
  gp = gpar(
    col = "grey50",
    fontsize = 16,
    fontfamily = "Econ Sans Cnd"
  )
)
```
<br>

Voil√†! We nailed it! üéâ

# The extra mile
***

If you are attentive to the smallest of the details you may have noticed the 
titles in the chart above aren't aligned to the leftmost side of the figure as
in the original chart.

One alternative, the one we used [here](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/web-horizontal-barplot-with-labels-the-economist.html),
is to remove the titles made with `ggplot2` and make all the annotations from
scratch using the `grid` library. Do you like challenges? 
Then have a look at the article and go for it!
