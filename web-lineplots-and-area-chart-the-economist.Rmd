# About
***

This page showcases the work by the data visualization team at 
[The Economist](https://www.economist.com/). You can find the original chart in 
[this article](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/08/23/the-number-of-child-labourers-has-increased-for-the-first-time-in-20-years).

Thanks to them for all the inspiring and insightful visualizations! Thanks also
to [Tom√°s Capretto](https://tcapretto.netlify.app/) who replicated the chart 
in R! üôèüôè

As a teaser, here is the plot we‚Äôre gonna try building:

At first sight, one may be tempted to think that today's chart looks rather 
simple. However, it actually contains several subtle customizations that when 
added all together make the final result look beautiful and original. This is 
also going to be a great opportunity to use the `grid` library, the drawing
library behind `ggplot2`, and [`shadowtext`](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/shadowtext),
a library that allows us to draw text with shadows.


```{r}
library(grid)
library(ggnewscale)
library(ggtext)
library(tidyverse)
library(shadowtext)
library(patchwork)
```

# Create data
***

The chart we're going to reproduce today is made of two separated plots, a 
linechart and a stacked area chart. We'll do the linechart first.

First of all, let's get started by creating the objects that are going to hold 
the data for us. Note these values are inferred from the original plot and not 
something computed from the original data source.

And let's also define the colors:

```{r}
BROWN <- "#AD8C97"
BROWN_DARKER <- "#7d3a46"
GREEN <- "#2FC1D3"
BLUE <- "#076FA1"
GREY <- "#C7C9CB"
GREY_DARKER <- "#5C5B5D"
RED <- "#E3120B"
```
<br>

```{r}
regions <- c(
  "Sub-Saharan Africa", 
  "Asia and the Pacific", 
  "Latin America and the Caribbean"
)

line_data <- data.frame(
  year = rep(c(2008, 2012, 2016, 2020), 3),
  percent = c(25.5, 21, 22.2, 24, 13.5, 9.5, 7.5, 5.5,10, 9, 7.5, 5.8),
  region = factor(rep(regions, each = 4), levels = regions)
)

line_labels<- data.frame(
  labels = c("Sub-Saharan Africa", "Asia and the Pacific", "Latin America and\nthe Caribbean"),
  x = c(2007.9, 2010, 2007.9),
  y = c(27, 13, 5.8),
  color = c(BLUE, GREEN, BROWN_DARKER)
)
```


```{r}
regions <- c(
  "Sub-Saharan Africa", 
  "Asia and the Pacific", 
  "Latin America and the Caribbean", 
  "Rest of world"
)

stacked_data <- data.frame(
  year = rep(c(2008, 2012, 2016, 2020), 4),
  percent = c(65, 55, 67, 85, 130, 85, 65, 50, 10, 10, 10, 8, 60, 20, 10, 16),
  region = factor(rep(regions, each = 4), levels = rev(regions))
)

stacked_labels <- data.frame(
  labels = c(
    "Sub-Saharan Africa", 
    "Asia and the Pacific", 
    "Latin America and\nthe Caribbean",
    "Rest\nof world"
  ),
  x = c(2014, 2014, 2014, 2008.1),
  y = c(25, 100, 225, 225),
  color = c("white", "white", BROWN_DARKER, GREY_DARKER)
)
```

# Basic linechart
***

Creating a [basic linechart](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/line-plot.html) 
with ggplot 2 is quite simple. 

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, dpi=300, out.width="80%"}
plt1 <- ggplot(line_data, aes(year, percent, group = region)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = region), size = 3) +
  geom_point(
    aes(fill = region), 
    size = 5, 
    pch = 21, 
    color = "white", 
    stroke = 1
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(BLUE, GREEN, BROWN)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(BLUE, GREEN, BROWN))  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")

plt1
```
<br>

# Customize layout
***

The next step is to customize the layout: modify the axes configuration, change
the color of the background, remove the tick marks, add grid lines, 
change the fonts, and more. Sounds like things to change? 
Come on, it's not going to bee too hard!

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, dpi=300, out.width="90%"}
plt1 <- plt1 + 
  scale_x_continuous(
    limits = c(2007.5, 2021.5),
    expand = c(0, 0), # The horizontal axis does not extend to either side
    breaks = c(2008, 2012, 2016, 2020),
    labels = c("2008", "12", "16", "20")
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(0, 32),
    breaks = seq(0, 30, by = 5), 
    expand = c(0, 0)
  ) + 
  theme(
    # Set background color to white
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
    # Remove all grid lines
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    # But add grid lines for the vertical axis, customizing color and size 
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "#A8BAC4", size = 0.3),
    # Remove tick marks by setting their length to 0
    axis.ticks.length.y = unit(0, "mm"), 
    axis.ticks.length.x = unit(2, "mm"),
    # Remove the title for both axes
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    # Only bottom line of the vertical axis is painted in black
    axis.line.x.bottom = element_line(color = "black"),
    # Remove labels from the vertical axis
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    # But customize labels for the horizontal axis
    axis.text.x = element_text(family = "Econ Sans Cnd", size = 16)
  )

plt1
```
<br>

# Add labels
***

Customizing the layout was a big step towards to the final chart. But there's 
still work to be done. 

So far, the chart doesn't indicate anything about which disease is represented 
by each bar. Isn't it frustrating? So now it is a good idea to add labels to the 
bars. Let's do it!

The following chunk uses both `geom_text()` and `geom_shadowtext()`. The first
one is used to draw regular text within the bars of the diseases with a count
equal or above 8. On the other hand `geom_shadowtext()` is used to draw text
with shadow to the right of the bars of the diseases with a count below 8. This
shadow is a subtle but important detail that hides the grid line at 10 that
passes behind the text.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, dpi=300, out.width="90%"}
plt1 <- plt1 + 
  new_scale_color() + 
  geom_shadowtext(
    aes(x, y, label = labels, color = color),
    data = line_labels,
    hjust = 0,
    bg.colour = "white",
    bg.r = 0.2,
    family = "Econ Sans Cnd",
    size = 6,
    inherit.aes = FALSE
  ) + 
  scale_color_identity()

plt1 <- plt1 + 
  geom_text(
    data = data.frame(x = 2021.5, y = seq(0, 30, by = 5)),
    aes(x, y, label = y),
    hjust = 1,
    vjust = 0,
    nudge_y = 30 * 0.01, # The pad is equal to 1% of the vertical range (35 - 0)
    family = "Econ Sans Cnd",
    size = 6,
    inherit.aes = FALSE
  )

plt1
```
<br>

# Add annotations and final tweaks
***

Adding titles is one of those steps that are simple from the technical point of 
view but can make a huge difference in the quality of the chart. 

The next chunk shows how to add a title and a subtitle to a ggplot2 chart using
the `labs()` function. Later, their aspect is customized using `theme()`.


```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, dpi=300, out.width="90%"}
plt1 <- plt1 +
  labs(
    title = "**Selected regions,** % of child population",
  ) + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_markdown(
      family = "Econ Sans Cnd", 
      size = 18
    )
  )

plt1
```
<br>


# Stacked area chart
***

Thanks to the `geom_area()` function, it is quite straightforward to create a 
[stacked area chart](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/stacked-area-graph.html) 
in Matplotlib. 





```{r}
plt2 <- ggplot(stacked_data) +
  geom_area(aes(year, percent, fill = region), color = "white") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(GREY, BROWN, GREEN, BLUE)) +
  theme(legend.position = "None")

plt2
```


# Customize layout
***

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6, dpi=300, out.width="90%"}

plt2 <- plt2 + 
  scale_x_continuous(
    limits = c(2007.5, 2021.5),
    expand = c(0, 0),
    breaks = c(2008, 2012, 2016, 2020),
    labels = c("2008", "12", "16", "20")
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(0, 320),
    breaks = seq(0, 300, by = 50), 
    expand = c(0, 0)
  ) + 
  theme(
    # Set background color to white
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
    # Remove all grid lines
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    # But add grid lines for the vertical axis, customizing color and size 
    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "#A8BAC4", size = 0.3),
    # Remove tick marks by setting their length to 0
    axis.ticks.length.y = unit(0, "mm"), 
    axis.ticks.length.x = unit(2, "mm"),
    # Remove the title for both axes
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    # Only bottom line of the vertical axis is painted in black
    axis.line.x.bottom = element_line(color = "black"),
    # Remove labels from the vertical axis
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    # But customize labels for the horizontal axis
    axis.text.x = element_text(family = "Econ Sans Cnd", size = 16)
  )

plt2
```
<br>


# Add labels and annotations
***

Again, the pad is equal to 1% of the vertical range.

```{r}
plt2 <- plt2 + 
  geom_text(
    aes(x, y, label = labels, color = color),
    data = stacked_labels,
    hjust = 0,
    vjust = 0.5,
    family = "Econ Sans Cnd",
    size = 6,
    inherit.aes = FALSE
  ) + 
  scale_color_identity()

plt2 <- plt2 +
  geom_text(
    data = data.frame(x = 2021.5, y = seq(0, 300, by = 50)),
    aes(x, y, label = y),
    hjust = 1,
    vjust = 0,
    nudge_y = 300 * 0.01,
    family = "Econ Sans Cnd",
    size = 6,
    inherit.aes = FALSE
  )

plt2 <- plt2 + 
  geom_curve(
    aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend),
    data = data.frame(x = 2016.9, y = 210, xend = 2018.8, yend = 138),
    curvature = -0.5,
    angle = 90
  ) +
  geom_point(
    aes(x, y), 
    data = data.frame(x = 2018.8, y = 138),
    color = "black"
  )


plt2 <- plt2 + 
  labs(
    title = "**Number of children,** m",
  ) + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_markdown(
      family = "Econ Sans Cnd", 
      size = 18
    )
  )

plt2
```



```{r}
plt1 <- plt1 + theme(plot.margin = margin(0, 0.05, 0, 0, "npc"))
plt2 <- plt2 + theme(plot.margin = margin(0, 0, 0.05, 0, "npc"))

plt <- plt1 | plt2

title_theme <- theme(
  plot.title = element_text(
    family = "Econ Sans Cnd", 
    face = "bold",
    size = 22,
    margin = margin(0.8, 0, 0, 0, "npc")
  ),
  plot.subtitle = element_text(
    family = "Econ Sans Cnd",
    size = 20,
    margin = margin(0.4, 0, 0, 0, "npc")
  )
)

plt <- plt + plot_annotation(
    title = "All work, no play",
    subtitle = "Children in child labour*",
    theme = title_theme
  ) +
  theme(
    plot.margin = margin(0.075, 0, 0.1, 0, "npc"),
  )
```


```{r}
png("plot.png", width = 14, height = 7.2, res = 300, units = "in")

plt

grid.lines(
  x = c(0, 1),
  y = 1,
  gp = gpar(col = "#e5001c", lwd = 4)
)

# Add rectangle on top-left
# lwd = 0 means the rectangle does not have an outer line
# 'just' gives the horizontal and vertical justification
grid.rect(
  x = 0,
  y = 1,
  width = 0.05,
  height = 0.025,
  just = c("left", "top"),
  gp = gpar(fill = "#e5001c", lwd = 0)
)


grid.text(
  'Source: "Child Labour: Global estimates 2020, trends and the road forward", ILO and UNICEF', 
  x = 0.005, 
  y = 0.06, 
  just = c("left", "bottom"),
  gp = gpar(
    col = GREY,
    fontsize = 16,
    fontfamily = "Econ Sans Cnd"
  )
)
grid.text(
  "The Economist",

  )
)

dev.off()
```


This is how far we were able to get with ggplot2 alone. It's quite evident the 
chart does not look like the original chart on top. It's still missing the 
red line and rectangle on top, which is like a watermark of visualizations made
by The Economist.

We're going to use the `grid` library for this task. `grid` is a low-level 
plotting library that comes with any `R` installation by default and provides 
many plotting primitive functions. It is also the library that `ggplot2` uses to 
create the charts under the hood, and that's why we can combine them in the 
same chart.


```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=7, dpi=300, out.width="90%"}
# Make room for annotations
plt <- plt + 
  theme(
    plot.margin = margin(0.05, 0, 0.1, 0.01, "npc")
  )

# Print the ggplot2 plot
plt

# Add horizontal line on top
# It goes from x = 0 (left) to x = 1 (right) on the very top of the chart (y = 1)
# You can think of 'gp' and 'gpar' as 'graphical parameters'.
# There we indicate the line color and width
grid.lines(
  x = c(0, 1),
  y = 1,
  gp = gpar(col = "#e5001c", lwd = 4)
)

# Add rectangle on top-left
# lwd = 0 means the rectangle does not have an outer line
# 'just' gives the horizontal and vertical justification
grid.rect(
  x = 0,
  y = 1,
  width = 0.05,
  height = 0.025,
  just = c("left", "top"),
  gp = gpar(fill = "#e5001c", lwd = 0)
)

# We have two captions, so we use grid.text instead of 
# the caption provided by  ggplot2.
grid.text(
  "Sources: Laboratory-Acquired Infection Database; American Biological Safety Association", 
  x = 0.005, 
  y = 0.06, 
  just = c("left", "bottom"),
  gp = gpar(
    col = GREY,
    fontsize = 16,
    fontfamily = "Econ Sans Cnd"
  )
)
grid.text(
  "The Economist", 
  x = 0.005, 
  y = 0.005, 
  just = c("left", "bottom"),
  gp = gpar(
    col = GREY,
    fontsize = 16,
    fontfamily = "Milo TE W01"
  )
)
```
<br>

Just comparing the sizes of the chunks you can see it definitely takes a 
considerable amount of extra work to get the details done. 
But in the end... Aren't they're worth it?

# The extra mile
***

If you are attentive to the smallest of the details you may have noticed the 
titles in the chart above aren't aligned exactly in the same way than the titles
in the original chart. 

By default, `ggplot2` aligns titles using the panel region as 
reference. We asked ggplot2 to use the plot region as reference when we added
`plot.title.position = "plot"` in the `theme()` call. But it was not enought.
The title is not completely aligned to the left border of the chart, which
you can notice by comparing the position of the rectangle on top with the titles.

This extra step consists of removing the titles generated with `ggplot2` and
replacing them with text drawn with the `grix.text()` function.


```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=7, dpi=300, out.width="90%"}
plt <- plt + 
  labs(title = NULL, subtitle = NULL) +
  theme(
    plot.margin = margin(0.15, 0, 0.1, 0.01, "npc")
  )

plt 

grid.text(
  "Escape artists", 
  0, 
  0.925,
  just = c("left", "bottom"),
  gp = gpar(
    fontsize = 22,
    fontface = "bold",
    fontfamily = "Econ Sans Cnd"
  )
)

grid.text(
  "Number of laboratory-acquired infections, 1970-2021", 
  0, 
  0.875,
  just = c("left", "bottom"),
  gp = gpar(
    fontsize = 20,
    fontfamily = "Econ Sans Cnd"
  )
)

grid.lines(
  x = c(0, 1),
  y = 1,
  gp = gpar(col = "#e5001c", lwd = 4)
)

grid.rect(
  x = 0,
  y = 1,
  width = 0.05,
  height = 0.025,
  just = c("left", "top"),
  gp = gpar(fill = "#e5001c", lwd = 0)
)

grid.text(
  "Sources: Laboratory-Acquired Infection Database; American Biological Safety Association", 
  x = 0.005, 
  y = 0.06, 
  just = c("left", "bottom"),
  gp = gpar(
    col = GREY,
    fontsize = 16,
    fontfamily = "Econ Sans Cnd"
  )
)

grid.text(
  "The Economist", 
  x = 0.005, 
  y = 0.005, 
  just = c("left", "bottom"),
  gp = gpar(
    col = GREY,
    fontsize = 16,
    fontfamily = "Milo TE W01"
  )
)
```
<br>

It's so satisfying to have nail it after so much work!

# Final notes
***

If you attempt to save the plot above with `ggsave()` you'll end up with a 
file that only reflects what is done with `ggplot2`. The right way to save
this chart that mixes `ggplot2` and `grid` is to use more low-level functions
such as `png()`. For example

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Open file to store the plot
png("plot.png", width = 12, height = 7, units = "in", res = 300)

# Print the plot
plt 

grid.text(
  "Escape artists", 
  0, 
  0.925,
  just = c("left", "bottom"),
  gp = gpar(
    fontsize = 22,
    fontface = "bold",
    fontfamily = "Econ Sans Cnd"
  )
)

grid.text(
  "Number of laboratory-acquired infections, 1970-2021", 
  0, 
  0.875,
  just = c("left", "bottom"),
  gp = gpar(
    fontsize = 20,
    fontfamily = "Econ Sans Cnd"
  )
)

grid.lines(
  x = c(0, 1),
  y = 1,
  gp = gpar(col = "#e5001c", lwd = 4)
)

grid.rect(
  x = 0,
  y = 1,
  width = 0.05,
  height = 0.025,
  just = c("left", "top"),
  gp = gpar(fill = "#e5001c", lwd = 0)
)

grid.text(
  "Sources: Laboratory-Acquired Infection Database; American Biological Safety Association", 
  x = 0.005, 
  y = 0.06, 
  just = c("left", "bottom"),
  gp = gpar(
