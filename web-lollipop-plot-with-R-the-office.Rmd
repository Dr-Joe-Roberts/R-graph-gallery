This page showcases the work of [Cedric Sherer](https://www.cedricscherer.com), built for the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) initiative. You can find the original code on his github repository [here](https://github.com/z3tt/TidyTuesday/blob/master/R/2020_12_TheOffice.Rmd). Thanks to him for accepting sharinig his work here! üôèüôè

About the dataset. A bit of explanation of what the dataset is about. A link to the dataset on the tidyTuesday.

## Package and Theme
***

As always several packages are needed in order to build the figure. In this 
occasion, we also import some fonts from Google via the `font_add_google()`
function.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)
library(showtext)

# Add fonts from Google.
font_add_google("Roboto Mono", "Roboto Mono")
font_add_google("Open Sans", "Open Sans")
font_add_google("Special Elite", "Special Elite")

# Set ggplot theme
theme_set(theme_minimal(base_family = "Roboto Mono"))
theme_update(
  plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#fafaf5", color = "#fafaf5"),
  panel.background = element_rect(fill = NA, color = NA),
  panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, color = NA),
  panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
  panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
  axis.text.x = element_blank(),
  axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
  axis.ticks = element_blank(),
  axis.title.y = element_text(size = 13, margin = margin(r = 10)),
  legend.title = element_text(size = 9),
  plot.caption = element_text(
    family = "Special Elite",
    size = 10,
    color = "grey70",
    face = "bold",
    hjust = .5,
    margin = margin(5, 0, 20, 0)
  ),
  plot.margin = margin(10, 25, 10, 25)
)
```

# Load and prepare the dataset
***

Today we are creating a highly customized lollipop plot to visualize IMDB ratings
for each episode of the television show The Office (US). The data originally comes from
the [`schrute` R package](https://bradlindblad.github.io/schrute/index.html)
and [data.world](https://data.world/anujjain7/the-office-imdb-ratings-dataset), but
we are using the version released for the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) 
initiative on the week of 2020-03-17. You can find the original announcement and
more information about the data [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-03-17).

First, we read the data set and take a look at the first few rows to get familiar 
with the data.

```{r}
df_office <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-03-17/office_ratings.csv')
head(df_office)
```

<br>

From all the columns included in the data, we use the season (`season`), the
episode number (`episode`), the IMDB rating (`imdb_rating`), and the number 
of votes used for each rating (`total_votes`).

Compute the average rating per season. Observations are arranged by `season` and
`episode` to make sure `row_number()` represents the episode number irrespective
of the season. `season` is mutated into a factor type so `ggplot2` recognizes it
as a discrete variable instead of numeric.

<!--TODO: What is `episode_mod`?-->

```{r}
df_office_avg <-
  df_office %>% 
  arrange(season, episode) %>% 
  mutate(episode_id = row_number()) %>% 
  group_by(season) %>% 
  mutate(
    avg = mean(imdb_rating),
    episode_mod = episode_id + (9 * season),
    mid = mean(episode_mod)
  ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(season = factor(season))
```

<br>

Now we construct the data frame that is used to plot the horizontal lines with
the mean rating per season.

```{r}
df_lines <-
  df_office_avg %>% 
  group_by(season) %>% 
  summarize(
    start_x = min(episode_mod) - 5,
    end_x = max(episode_mod) + 5,
    y = unique(avg)
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(start_x, end_x),
    names_to = "type",
    values_to = "x"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    x_group = if_else(type == "start_x", x + .1, x - .1),
    x_group = if_else(type == "start_x" & x == min(x), x_group - .1, x_group),
    x_group = if_else(type == "end_x" & x == max(x), x_group + .1, x_group)
  )

```

## Plot
***

Now let's build the chart. We do it in a step-by-step fashion, adding comments
to explain what we are adding each time.

```{r}
# First, horizontal lines that are used as scale reference. They are added first
# to ensure they stay in the background.
p <- df_office_avg %>% 
  ggplot(aes(episode_mod, imdb_rating)) +
    geom_hline(
      data = tibble(y = 7:10),
      aes(yintercept = y),
      color = "grey82",
      size = .5
    )


# Add vertical segments. They represent how much the rating of each episode
# deviates from the rating of the season they appeared.
p <- p + 
  geom_segment(
    aes(
      xend = episode_mod,
      yend = avg, 
      color = season, 
      color = after_scale(colorspace::lighten(color, .2))
    )
  )

# Add vertical lines connecting edges of season's means
# and horizontal lines representing mean rating for each season.
p <- p + 
  geom_line(
    data = df_lines,
    aes(x, y),
    color = "grey40"
  ) +
  geom_line(
    data = df_lines,
    aes(
      x_group, 
      y, 
      color = season, 
      color = after_scale(colorspace::darken(color, .2))
    ),
    size = 2.5
  ) + 
  geom_point(
    aes(size = total_votes, color = season)
  ) 
```

<br>

So far, the plot looks as follows

```{r, include=FALSE}

  here::here("img", "lollipop-plot-with-R-the-office-preview.png"),

TODO: Add logo, make sure fonts are correctly rendered, etc...
Now we're gonna add a logo

```
# This does not work yet.

# And then call it here and store it as web-loollipop-plot-with-R-the-office.png

#ggsave(here::here("plots", "2020_12", "2020_12_TheOffice.pdf"), 
       #width = 15, height = 9, device = cairo_pdf)

#Once the chart is saved, use Markdown to include the png in the page.
