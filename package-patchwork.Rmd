# In a nutshell:
***

**goal**: easily combine multiple ggplot objects into a cohesive visualization

‚úçÔ∏è **author**: Thomas Lin Pedersen

üìò **documentation**: [github](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/)

‚≠êÔ∏è *highly acclaimed and widely used in the ggplot2 community*

# Installation
***
Getting started with `patchwork` is simple. 

You can install `patchwork` directly from CRAN using the `install.packages` function:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("patchwork")
```

# Key features
***

The `patchwork` package in R is designed to seamlessly combine multiple [ggplot2](https://r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-package.html) plots. 

It provides an intuitive syntax and a set of operators to **arrange, annotate, and align** plots, making it an indispensable tool for creating complex visualizations from individual ggplot objects.

# Basic usage 
***

Combining plots with `patchwork` is as simple as using mathematical operators:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)

p1 <- ggplot(mtcars) + geom_point(aes(mpg, disp))
p2 <- ggplot(mtcars) + geom_boxplot(aes(gear, disp, group = gear))

p1 + p2
```
