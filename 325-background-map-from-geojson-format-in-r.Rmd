If you did not find the geospatial data you need in existing R packages (see the [map section](map.html)), you need to find this information elsewhere on the web.

It will often be stored as a `.geomJSON` format. This post explains how to read it.

<u>Note</u>: if you found a `shapefile`, read [this post](168-load-a-shape-file-into-r.html) instead.










# Find and download a `.geoJSON` file
***

You need to dig the internet to find the geoJSON file you are interested in. For instance, [this URL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gregoiredavid/france-geojson/master/communes.geojson) provides a file containing french region boundaries.

You can load it in R with:

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Let's read the jeoJson file that is stored on the web with the geojsonio library:
# install.packages("geojsonio")
library(geojsonio)
spdf <- geojson_read("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gregoiredavid/france-geojson/master/communes.geojson",  what = "sp")
```

<br>

That's it! You now have a geospatial object called `spdf`. I strongly advise to read [this post](169-170-basic-manipulation-of-shapefiles) to learn how to manipulate it.

Just in case, here is how to plot it in base R and with `ggplot2`.







# Plot it with `base R`
***

<div class = "row">

<div class = "col-md-6  col-sm-12 align-self-center">

The basic `plot()` function knows how to plot a geospatial object. Thus you just need to pass it `spdf` and add a couple of options to customize the output.

</div>


<div class = "col-md-6  col-sm-12">

```{r thecode4, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.height=4}
# Select only the region #6
spdf@data$mystate = substr( spdf@data$code, 1, 2)
spdf_region_6 = spdf[ spdf@data$mystate == "06" , ]

# plot the selected are with sp
library(sp)
par(mar=c(0,0,0,0))
plot(spdf_region_6, col="grey")
```

</div>
</div>

```{r thecode4, eval=FALSE}
```













# Plot it with `ggplot2`
***

<div class = "row">

<div class = "col-md-6  col-sm-12 align-self-center">

It is totally possible (and advised imo) to build the map with [ggplot2](ggplot2-package.html). However, ggplot2 takes as input data frames, not geospatial data.

The geospatial object thus needs to be transformed using the `tidy()` function of the `broom` package.

Once the data frame is created, it is plotted using the `geom_polygon()` function as described below.

</div>


<div class = "col-md-6  col-sm-12">

```{r thecode5, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.height=4}
# 'fortify' the data to get a dataframe format required by ggplot2
library(broom)
spdf_fortified <- tidy(spdf_region_6)

# Plot it
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = spdf_fortified, aes( x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill="#69b3a2", color="white") +
  theme_void() +
  coord_map()
```
</div>
</div>

```{r thecode5, eval=FALSE}
```







<!-- Close container -->

```{r, echo=FALSE}
