# Introduction
***

Fonts are one of the most important aspects of a good visualization. Choosing 
the right font can make a huge difference in the readability and overall 
quality of a chart. [[showtext](package/showtext.html)](https://github.com/yixuan/showtext) and 
[`ragg`](https://ragg.r-lib.org/) are two R packages that help to work with custom
fonts in R and `ggplot2`. 

- [showtext](package/showtext.html) provides a set of functions that make it easy
to use various types of fonts in R plots
- `ragg` provides graphic devices 
based on the [AGG](https://antigrain.com/) library, which gives direct access
to all system fonts, making the usage of custom fonts painless and easy.

The following two fonts are going to be used in along this post:

* **Hydrophilia Iced** from [Floodfonts](https://www.floodfonts.com/). 
[Here](https://www.floodfonts.com/freefont/download/hydrophilia.zip) 
you can download a zipped folder that contains the font as both `.otf` and `.ttf` types.
* **Special Elite** from Google Fonts [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Special+Elite).






# Custom fonts with [showtext](package/showtext.html)
***

The easiest way to add a custom font is to use `font_add_google()`. This function
will search the Google Fonts repository for a specified family name, download 
the proper font files, and then add them to `sysfonts` (an auxiliar package that 
makes [showtext](package/showtext.html) work). See how simple it is in practice:

```{r}
library(showtext)
font_add_google("Special Elite", family = "special")
```

<br>

The second argument, `family`, is optional. It gives the family name of the 
font that will be used in R. In other words, it means that the name used to 
refer to the font in R does not need to be the same than the original name of 
the font. In this case, the font **Special Elite** is going to be the **special**
family.

_note_: if the font wanted is not available on Google Fonts, one can use `font_add()`.
The first argument is like the `family` above, and the second argument
is a path to the font file for the font face (both `.ttf` and `.otf` work). Not that you have to download the
font locally and update the path below

<!-- Use the right if knitting this again. -->

```{r, eval=FALSE}
font_add("hydrophilia", "~/Downloads/Hydrophilia/HydrophiliaIced-Regular.ttf")
```

<br>

And last but not least, `showtext_auto()` must be called to indicate that 
[showtext](package/showtext.html) is going to be automatically invoked to draw text whenever a plot
is created. 

```{r}
showtext_auto()
```

<br>

Now it's a good time to make a plot to showcase the fonts just imported and see 
how they look like.

```{r, fig.showtext=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)

data <- data.frame(x = 1:4, y = 1:4)

ggplot(data) +
  geom_point(aes(x, y), size = 10, color = "cadetblue4") +
  geom_label(
    aes(x, y),
    data = data.frame(x = 3, y = 2),
    label = "This is Hydrophilia Iced!",
    family = "hydrophilia", # Use Hydrophilia Iced for the label,
    size = 7
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "Horizontal Label",
    y = "Vertical label too!",
    title = "Do you like titles with nice-looking fonts?"
  ) +
  theme(
    # Special Elite for both axis title and plot title
    axis.title = element_text(family = "special"),
    title = element_text(family = "special")
  )
```

<br>

Cool! That worked pretty well!

However, it's good to note some caveats with [showtext](package/showtext.html) before jumping to the 
next section:

* If you are using [showtext](package/showtext.html) in a common R script, set `dpi` according to the 
device you use to export your figure via `showtext_opts(dpi = dpi)`. For example
if you use `ggsave()`, then you need to set up a `dpi` of 300.
* If you are using [showtext](package/showtext.html) in RMarkdown documents you don't have to
use `showtext_auto()`. That will set up the wrong dpi and the text will look too
small. You need to add `fig.showtext=TRUE` to the chunk settings as 
shown [here](https://statr.me/2014/07/showtext-with-knitr/).
* For more information about these issues see [here](https://github.com/yixuan/showtext/issues/51).


# Custom fonts with `ragg`
***

This solution provided in this section is quite different from the solution above.
Instead of using a library to install and manage fonts that are accesible by R,
this solution is based on using a different graphic device provided by `ragg`. 

Among other very nice features, using `ragg` gives access to all system fonts, 
which means that custom fonts can be used without having to install other package
in R.

Assuming RStudio is used to work with R, `ragg` can be set up as the graphic
back-end to the Rstudio device (for RStudio >= 1.4) by choosing AGG as the
backend in the graphics pane in general options (see screenshot)

![](img/ragg.png){width=70%}

<br>

Also, `ragg` can be used with RMarkdown documents. `knitr`  supports png output 
from `ragg` by setting `dev = "ragg_png"` in the chunk settings or globally 
with `knitr::opts_chunk$set(dev = "ragg_png")`.

Finally, if you are going to export your plot with `ggsave()`, you can simply
pass device functions from `ragg` into the `device` argument as 
`ggsave("image.png", device=ragg::agg_png)`.

In practice, you need to download and install the fonts in your system manually.
This is usually done by opening the font file and clicking on the install button
in the window that pops up. One of its advantages is that this procedure
is required only once per font. After a font is installed in your system it can
be used anywhere in your R plots without having to use any external packages
such as [showtext](package/showtext.html).

Let's generate the same plot than above, but using the `ragg::agg_png` backend. 

```{r, include=FALSE}
# needs to be turned off
showtext_auto(FALSE)
```

````{r, warning=FALSE}
library(ragg)
```

```{r, dev = "ragg_png"}
# Quick notes:
# * No "showtext_auto()" or similar calls
# * Full names must be used for the fonts because they are now
#   searched in the system

data <- data.frame(x = 1:4, y = 1:4)

ggplot(data) +
  geom_point(aes(x, y), size = 10, color = "cadetblue4") +
  geom_label(
    aes(x, y),
    data = data.frame(x = 3, y = 2),
    label = "This is Hydrophilia Iced!",
    family = "Hydrophilia Iced",
    size = 7
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "Horizontal Label",
    y = "Vertical label too!",
    title = "Do you like titles with nice-looking fonts?"
  ) +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_text(family = "Special Elite"),
    title = element_text(family = "Special Elite")
  )
```
