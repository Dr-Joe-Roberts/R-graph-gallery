# About
***

This page showcases the work of [Gilbert Fontana](https://twitter.com/GilbertFontana?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), which was originally published on [twitter](https://twitter.com/GilbertFontana/status/1681734005668888601).

Thanks to him for accepting sharing his work here! As a teaser, here is the plot weâ€™re gonna try building:

# Required packaged
***

As usual, let's start by loading some **libraries**. 

Today's plot requires quite a lot of packages to be built. You can install them with the `install.packages()` function. Once installed, load them with the `library()` function:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(readxl)
library(ggstream)
library(showtext)
library(ggtext)
```
<br>

You are probably familiar with the `tidyverse` already. `readxl` will be used in the next section to load the dataset.


# Load and prepare the data
***

This guide shows how to create a beautiful circular barplot to visualize several characteristics of hiking locations in Washington.

The data for this post comes from [Washington Trails Association](https://www.wta.org/go-outside/hikes?b_start:int=1) courtesy of the [TidyX crew](https://github.com/thebioengineer/TidyX/tree/master/TidyTuesday_Explained/035-Rectangles), [Ellis Hughes](https://twitter.com/Ellis_hughes) and [Patrick Ward](https://twitter.com/OSPpatrick). This guide uses the dataset released for the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) initiative on the week of 2020-11-24. You can find the original announcement and more information about the data [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-11-24). Thank you all for making this possible!

Let's start by loading the dataset:

```{r}
hike_data <- readr::read_rds(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-11-24/hike_data.rds"))
```
<br>

The first step is to extract the **region** from the `location` column. 
This is given by the text before the `"--"`.

```{r}
hike_data$region <- as.factor(word(hike_data$location, 1, sep = " -- "))
```
<br>

A similar approach is used to extract the **number of miles**.

```{r}
hike_data$length_num <- as.numeric(sapply(strsplit(hike_data$length, " "), "[[", 1))
```
<br>

And finally, compute the **cumulative length** and **mean gain** for each 
region, as well as recording the **number of tracks** per region.

```{r}
plot_df <- hike_data %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarise(
    sum_length = sum(length_num),
    mean_gain = mean(as.numeric(gain)),
    n = n()
  ) %>%
  mutate(mean_gain = round(mean_gain, digits = 0))
```
<br>

# Basic radar chart
***

Converting a plot from cartesian to circular (polar) coordinates in `ggplot2` 
is as easy as adding a `coord_polar()` call to the plot.

```{r}
plt <- ggplot(plot_df) +
  # Make custom panel grid
  geom_hline(
    aes(yintercept = y),
    data.frame(y = c(0:3) * 1000),
    color = "lightgrey"
  ) +
  # Add bars to represent the cumulative track lengths
  # str_wrap(region, 5) wraps the text so each line has at most 5 characters
  # (but it doesn't break long words!)
  geom_col(
    aes(
      x = reorder(str_wrap(region, 5), sum_length),
      y = sum_length,
      fill = n
    ),
    position = "dodge2",
    show.legend = TRUE,
    alpha = .9
  ) +

  # Add dots to represent the mean gain
  geom_point(
    aes(
      x = reorder(str_wrap(region, 5), sum_length),
      y = mean_gain
    ),
    size = 3,
    color = "gray12"
  ) +

  # Lollipop shaft for mean gain per region
  geom_segment(
    aes(
      x = reorder(str_wrap(region, 5), sum_length),
      y = 0,
      xend = reorder(str_wrap(region, 5), sum_length),
      yend = 3000
    ),
    linetype = "dashed",
    color = "gray12"
  ) +

  # Make it circular!
  coord_polar()

plt
```
<br>

Not too bad! It's clear the plot isn't ready for publication yet. But the 
take-home message so far must be about how easy it is to convert one regular 
plot into a circular plot by using `coord_polar()`. 
Now, wanna make it better? Let's do it!

# Add annotations and legend

It's not clear what is represented by the height of the bars in the plot above. 
There are some vertical tick marks, but they aren't definitely placed in the right place. 
And what about the color? What does it mean? Let's improve this!

```{r}
plt <- plt +
  # Annotate the bars and the lollipops so the reader understands the scaling
  annotate(
    x = 11,
    y = 1300,
    label = "Mean Elevation Gain\n[FASL]",
    geom = "text",
    angle = -67.5,
    color = "gray12",
    size = 2.5,
    family = "Bell MT"
  ) +
  annotate(
    x = 11,
    y = 3150,
    label = "Cummulative Length [FT]",
    geom = "text",
    angle = 23,
    color = "gray12",
    size = 2.5,
    family = "Bell MT"
  ) +
  # Annotate custom scale inside plot
  annotate(
    x = 11.7,
    y = 1100,
    label = "1000",
    geom = "text",
    color = "gray12",
    family = "Bell MT"
  ) +
  annotate(
    x = 11.7,
    y = 2100,
    label = "2000",
    geom = "text",
    color = "gray12",
    family = "Bell MT"
  ) +
  annotate(
    x = 11.7,
    y = 3100,
    label = "3000",
    geom = "text",
    color = "gray12",
    family = "Bell MT"
  ) +
  # Scale y axis so bars don't start in the center
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(-1500, 3500),
    expand = c(0, 0),
    breaks = c(0, 1000, 2000, 3000)
  ) +
  # New fill and legend title for number of tracks per region
  scale_fill_gradientn(
    "Amount of Tracks",
    colours = c("#6C5B7B", "#C06C84", "#F67280", "#F8B195")
  ) +
  # Make the guide for the fill discrete
  guides(
    fill = guide_colorsteps(
      barwidth = 15, barheight = .5, title.position = "top", title.hjust = .5
    )
  ) +
  theme(
    # Remove axis ticks and text
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    # Use gray text for the region names
    axis.text.x = element_text(color = "gray12", size = 12),
    # Move the legend to the bottom
    legend.position = "bottom",
  )

plt
```

# Final chart
***

The plot above is much clearer than its previous version. However, it still
needs some tweaks to be ready to be published. First of all, 
default font is replaced with **Bell MT**. It adds a nice touch that makes it look
much better. Then, the background is changed to white. The default gray 
one doesn't feel quite right for this chart. And finally, we add good labels 
that make it easier to transmit what this chart is about.


```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=12.6, out.width="70%", fig.align="center"}
plt <- plt +
  # Add labels
  labs(
    title = "\nHiking Locations in Washington",
    subtitle = paste(
      "\nThis Visualisation shows the cummulative length of tracks,",
      "the amount of tracks and the mean gain in elevation per location.\n",
      "If you are an experienced hiker, you might want to go",
      "to the North Cascades since there are a lot of tracks,",
      "higher elevations and total length to overcome.",
      sep = "\n"
    ),
    caption = "\n\nData Visualisation by Tobias Stalder\ntobias-stalder.netlify.app\nSource: TidyX Crew (Ellis Hughes, Patrick Ward)\nLink to Data: github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-11-24/readme.md"
  ) +
  # Customize general theme
  theme(

    # Set default color and font family for the text
    text = element_text(color = "gray12", family = "Bell MT"),

    # Customize the text in the title, subtitle, and caption
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 25, hjust = 0.05),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.05),
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 10, hjust = .5),

    # Make the background white and remove extra grid lines
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = "white"),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()
  )
# Use `ggsave("plot.png", plt,width=9, height=12.6)` to save it as in the output
plt
```
<br>

Simple and beautiful!
