# About
***

This page showcases the work of [C√©dric Scherer](https://www.cedricscherer.com), 
built for the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) 
initiative. You can find the original code on his github repository 
[here](https://github.com/z3tt/TidyTuesday/blob/master/R/2020_27_ClaremontRunXMen.Rmd)

Thanks to him for accepting sharing his work here! üôèüôè Thanks also to 
[Tom√°s Capretto](https://tcapretto.netlify.app) who help writing down the blogpost!

As a teaser, here is the plot we're gonna try building:

# Packages and Theme
***

Let's start by loading the packages needed to build the figure. 
They are all great packages and today's chart wouldn't be possible without them.
But [`ggstream`](https://github.com/davidsjoberg/ggstream) is the one that
brings streamplots to `ggplot2` and deserves to be highlighted in this little
introduction.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(fuzzyjoin)
library(ggstream)
library(colorspace)
library(ggtext)
library(cowplot)
```

Next, we set the theme for the plot. This theme is built on top of 
`theme_minimal()` and uses the font `"Reem Kufi"`. Don't know how to make 
custom fonts work in `R`? Have a look at
[this guide](http://www.r-graph-gallery.com/custom-fonts-in-R-and-ggplot2) 
especially made for you! 

```{r, warning=FALSE}
theme_set(theme_minimal(base_family = "Reem Kufi", base_size = 12))

theme_update(
  plot.title = element_text(
    size = 25,
    face = "bold",
    hjust = .5,
    margin = margin(10, 0, 30, 0)
  ),
  plot.caption = element_text(
    size = 9,
    color = "grey40",
    hjust = .5,
    margin = margin(20, 0, 5, 0)
  ),
  axis.text.y = element_blank(),
  axis.title = element_blank(),
  plot.background = element_rect(fill = "grey88", color = NA),
  panel.background = element_rect(fill = NA, color = NA),
  panel.grid = element_blank(),
  panel.spacing.y = unit(0, "lines"),
  strip.text.y = element_blank(),
  legend.position = "bottom",
  legend.text = element_text(size = 9, color = "grey40"),
  legend.box.margin = margin(t = 30), 
  legend.background = element_rect(
    color = "grey40", 
    size = .3, 
    fill = "grey95"
  ),
  legend.key.height = unit(.25, "lines"),
  legend.key.width = unit(2.5, "lines"),
  plot.margin = margin(rep(20, 4))
)
```

# Load and prepare the dataset
***

This guide shows how to create a highly customized and beautiful streamchart to 
visualize the number of appearences of the most popular characters in Chris 
Claremont's sixteen-year run on Uncanny X-Men. 

The original source of data for this week are the [Claremont Run Project](http://www.claremontrun.com/) 
and [Malcom Barret](https://twitter.com/malco_barrett) who put these datasets 
into a the R package [cleremontrun](https://github.com/malcolmbarrett/claremontrun). 
This guide uses the `character_visualization` dataset released for the 
[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) initiative on the 
week of 2021-06-30. You can find the original announcement and more information 
about the data [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-06-30/readme.md). 
Thank you all for making this possible! 

```{r}
df_char_vis <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-06-30/character_visualization.csv')
```
<br>

The following is a data frame that ranks the most popular X-Men characters 
according to [this source](https://www.ranker.com/list/best-x-men-characters/ranker-comics). 
Today's chart is based on the top 5 most popular characters.

```{r}
df_best_chars <- tibble(
    rank = 1:10,
    char_popular = c("Wolverine", "Magneto", 
                     "Nightcrawler", "Gambit",
                     "Storm", "Colossus",
                     "Phoenix", "Professor X",
                     "Iceman", "Rogue")
  )
```
<br>

The `"character"` column in `df_char_vis` contains more information than just 
the name of the characters In the next chunk, `regex_inner_join()` from the
`fuzzyjoin` package automatically uses regular expressions to merge `df_char_vis` 
and `df_best_chars` into `df_best_stream`. This dataset contains the 
number of appearences per issue by character, costume, and type of appearence.


```{r}
df_best_stream <-  df_char_vis %>% 
  regex_inner_join(df_best_chars, by = c(character = "char_popular")) %>% 
  group_by(character, char_popular, costume, rank, issue) %>% 
  summarize_if(is.numeric, sum, na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  filter(rank <= 5) %>% # Keep top 5 characters
  filter(issue < 281)
```
<br>

The following step isn't strictly necessary, but it's a cool trick to make the 
start and end of the stream smoother. 

```{r}
df_smooth <- df_best_stream %>%
  group_by(character, char_popular, costume, rank) %>%
  slice(1:4) %>%
  mutate(
    issue = c(
      min(df_best_stream$issue) - 20,
      min(df_best_stream$issue) - 5,
      max(df_best_stream$issue) + 5,
      max(df_best_stream$issue) + 20
    ),
    speech = c(0, .001, .001, 0),
    thought = c(0, .001, .001, 0),
    narrative = c(0, .001, .001, 0),
    depicted = c(0, .001, .001, 0)
  )
```
<br>

The data is pivoted into a long format. A new variable, `char_costume`,
contains both the name of the character and the costume (costumed or casual).

```{r}
## factor levels for type of appearance
levels <- c("depicted", "speech", "thought", "narrative")

## factorized data in long format
df_best_stream_fct <- df_best_stream %>% 
  bind_rows(df_smooth) %>%
  mutate(
    costume = if_else(costume == "Costume", "costumed", "casual"),
    char_costume = if_else(
      char_popular == "Storm",
      glue::glue("{char_popular} ({costume})"),
      glue::glue("{char_popular} ({costume})   ")
    ),
    char_costume = fct_reorder(char_costume, rank)
  ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = speech:depicted,
    names_to = "parameter",
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(parameter = factor(parameter, levels = levels))
```
<br>

And finally, we define the color palette and some data that will be useful
when adding annotations to the plot.

```{r}
# Define the color palette
pal <- c(
  "#FFB400", lighten("#FFB400", .25, space = "HLS"),
  "#C20008", lighten("#C20008", .2, space = "HLS"),
  "#13AFEF", lighten("#13AFEF", .25, space = "HLS"),
  "#8E038E", lighten("#8E038E", .2, space = "HLS"),
  "#595A52", lighten("#595A52", .15, space = "HLS")
)

# These are going to be labels added to each panel
labels <- tibble(
    issue = 78,
    value = c(-21, -19, -14, -11),
    parameter = factor(levels, levels = levels),
    label = c("Depicted", "Speech\nBubbles", "Thought\nBubbles", "Narrative\nStatements")
  )

# These are going to be the text annotations
# If you wonder about the '**' or the '<sup>' within the text, let me tell you
# this is just Markdown syntax used by the ggtext library to make custom text
# annotations very easy!
texts <- tibble(
    issue = c(295, 80, 245, 127, 196),
    value = c(-35, 35, 30, 57, 55),
    parameter = c("depicted", "depicted", "thought", "speech", "speech"),
    text = c(
      '**Gambit** was introduced for the first time in issue #266 called "Gambit: Out of the Frying Pan"‚Äî nevertheless, he is the **4<sup>th</sup> most popular X-Men character**!',
      '**Wolverine is the most popular X-Men** and has a regular presence in the X-Men comics between 1975 and 1991.',
      '**Storm** is by far the most thoughtful of the five most popular X-Men characters, especially in issues #220, #223 and #265. Storm **ranks 5<sup>th</sup>**.',
      "**Magneto** was ranked by IGN as the *Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time*. And even though he only appears from time to time he **ranks 2<sup>nd</sup>**‚Äî<br>4 ranks higher than his friend and opponent Professor X!",
      'The **3<sup>rd</sup> most popular X-men character Nightcrawler** gets injured during the "Mutant Massacre"  and fell into a coma after an attack from Riptide in issue #211.'
    ),
    char_popular = c("Gambit", "Wolverine", "Storm", "Magneto", "Nightcrawler"),
    costume = "costumed",
    vjust = c(.5, .5, .4, .36, .38)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    parameter = factor(parameter, levels = levels),
    char_costume = if_else(
      char_popular == "Storm",
      glue::glue("{char_popular} ({costume})"),
      glue::glue("{char_popular} ({costume})   ")
    ),
    char_costume = factor(char_costume, levels = levels(df_best_stream_fct$char_costume))
  )
```
<br>

# Basic Plot
***

Thanks to `ggstream`, it's quite simple to build a streamchart in `ggplot2`. All
we need to use is the `geom_stream()` function. On top of that, this first version
also sets the color scales and uses `facet_grid()` to obtain one stream per
type of appearence.

```{r, fig.width=16, fig.height=13, out.width="95%"}
g <- df_best_stream_fct %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(
      issue, value, 
      color = char_costume, 
      fill = char_costume
    )
  ) +
  geom_stream(
    geom = "contour",
    color = "white",
    size = 1.25,
    bw = .45 # Controls smoothness
  ) +
  geom_stream(
    geom = "polygon",
    bw = .45,
    size = 0
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(
    expand = c(0, 0),
    values = pal,
    guide = "none"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = pal,
    name = NULL
  ) +
  facet_grid( ## needs facet_grid for space argument
    parameter ~ ., 
    scales = "free_y", 
    space = "free"
  )

g
```
<br>

Note `geom_stream()` is used twice above. The first time, it adds a white contour 
to each area. As a result, when the second stream is added on top, only the 
outermost contour line remains, creating a very nice highlighting effect. 
Nice trick!

# Add annotations
***

The plot above looks really well, but it's so minimalistic in its annotations
that it misses the opportunity to share important information. The next step is
to add **labels** and  **text** to make this chart more insightful.

```{r, fig.width=16, fig.height=13, out.width = "95%"}
g <- g + 
  geom_vline(
    data = tibble(x = c(97, seq(125, 250, by = 25), 280)),
    aes(xintercept = x),
    inherit.aes = FALSE, 
    color = "grey88", 
    size = .5,
    linetype = "dotted"
  ) +
  annotate(
    "rect",
    xmin = -Inf, xmax = 78, 
    ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf,
    fill = "grey88"
  ) +
  annotate(
    "rect",
    xmin = 299, xmax = Inf, 
    ymin = -Inf, ymax = Inf,
    fill = "grey88"
  ) +
  # Appearence type label on each panel
  geom_text(
    data = labels,
    aes(issue, value, label = label),
    family = "Reem Kufi",
    inherit.aes = FALSE,
    size = 4.7,
    color = "grey25",
    fontface = "bold",
    lineheight = .85,
    hjust = 0
  ) +
  # Add informative text
  # geom_textbox comes with the great ggtext library.
  geom_textbox(
    data = texts,
    aes(
      issue, value, 
      label = text,
      color = char_costume,
      color = after_scale(darken(color, .12, space = "HLS")),
      vjust = vjust
    ),
    family = "Reem Kufi",
    size = 2.7,
    fill = "grey95",
    maxwidth = unit(7.25, "lines"),
    hjust = .5
  ) + 
  # Customize labels of the horizontal axis
  scale_x_continuous(
    limits = c(74, NA),
    breaks = c(94, seq(125, 250, by = 25), 280),
    labels = glue::glue("Issue\n#{c(97, seq(125, 250, by = 25), 280)}"),
    position = "top"
  ) + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(.03, .03)) + 
  # This clip="off" is very important. It allows to have annotations anywhere
  # in the plot, no matter they are not within the extent of 
  # the corresponding panel.
  coord_cartesian(clip = "off")
  
g
```
<br>

Those annotations are definetely a game changer!

# Add title
***

There's been tremendous progress since the first chart. The last step is to add 
a very cool title that will make this marvelous even more attractive. The function `draw_image()` 
from the [`cowplot`](https://wilkelab.org/cowplot/index.html) 
library makes it really easy to add an image on top of the plot. 
Ready to finish this up? Let's go!

```{r, fig.width=16, fig.height=13, out.width = "95%"}
g <- g +
  labs(
    title = "Appearance of the Five Most Popular X-Men Characters in Chris Claremont's                           Comics",
    caption = "Visualization by C√©dric Scherer  ‚Ä¢  Data by Claremont Run Project via Malcom Barret  ‚Ä¢  Popularity Scores by ranker.com  ‚Ä¢  Logo by Comicraft"
  ) 

g <- ggdraw(g) + 
  # It works with only the path to the file! :)
  draw_image(
    "img/fromTheWeb/uncannyxmen.png", 
    x = .84, y = .955, 
    width = .1, 
    hjust = .5, 
    vjust = .5
  )
g
```
<br>

And finally, if you want to export this streamchart in a high quality format,
it's good to use `ggsave` with the `agg_png` device from the [`ragg`](https://ragg.r-lib.org/) 
library.

```{r}
ggsave("img/fromTheWeb/streamchart-xmen.png", g, 
       width = 16, height = 13, device = ragg::agg_png)
```
<br>

# Conclusion
***

Here we are, with a very highly customized plot showcasing the possibilities 
offered by the tidyverse and other packages like `ggstream`, `ggtext`, and many others. 
Thanks again to C√©dric for providing this chart example!
