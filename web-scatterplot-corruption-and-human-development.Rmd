# About
***

This page showcases the work of [Claus O. Wilke](https://clauswilke.com/) in his
R package [practicalgg](https://wilkelab.org/practicalgg/index.html) that 
contains step-by-step examples demonstrating how to get the most out of ggplot2. 
You can find the original code for this example
[here](https://wilkelab.org/practicalgg/articles/corruption_human_development.html).

Thanks to him for accepting sharing his work here! Thanks also to 
[Tom√°s Capretto](https://tcapretto.netlify.app/) who split the original code 
into this step-by-step guide! üôèüôè

As a teaser, here is the plot we're building today:

# Load packages
***

As usual, it is first necessary to load some packages before building the figure.
[ggrepel](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/articles/examples.html) provides geoms for
`ggplot2` to repel overlapping text labels. Text labels repel away from each other,
away from data points, and away from edges of the plotting area in an automatic
fashion. Also, [`colorspace`](https://hclwizard.org/r-colorspace/) is loaded
to use its function `darken()`, and [cowplot](../package/cowplot.html) 
contributes its `theme_minimal_hgrid()` built-in theme.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)
library(colorspace)
library(ggrepel)
```

# Load and prepare the dataset
***

Today's chart uses the [`corruption`](https://wilkelab.org/practicalgg/reference/corruption.html) 
dataset in the [`practicalgg`](https://wilkelab.org/practicalgg/index.html) 
package. This data contains information about Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI)
and Human Development Index (HDI) for 176 countries, from 2012 to 2015.

The original source are the [Corruption Perceptions Index 2016](https://www.transparency.org/en/news/corruption-perceptions-index-2016#table) 
released by [Transparency International](https://transparency.org) and the 
[Human Development Index](http://hdr.undp.org/en/data#) made available in the
[Human Development Reports](http://hdr.undp.org/en/) by the
[United Nations Development Programme](https://www.undp.org/). These datasets 
were merged and made available by [Claus O. Wilke](https://clauswilke.com/) as 
the `corruption` dataset in his `practicalgg` package. 
Thanks to Claus for all the work and making this possible!

The following chunk loads the data, keeps only observations for the 2015 year, 
and drops any row that contains a missing value.

```{r}
corrupt <- practicalgg::corruption %>%
  filter(year == 2015) %>%
  na.omit()
```
<br>

Next, longer region names are split into multiple lines so they fit better in 
the legend that goes on the top region of the plot.

```{r}
corrupt <- corrupt %>%
  mutate(
    region = case_when(
      region == "Middle East and North Africa" ~ "Middle East\nand North Africa",
      region == "Europe and Central Asia" ~ "Europe and\nCentral Asia",
      region == "Sub Saharan Africa" ~ "Sub-Saharan\nAfrica",
      TRUE ~ region # All the other remain the same
    )
  )
```
<br>

And finally, we add a new variable, `label`, that contains the name of some
selected countries. These countries are going to be added to the plot with the
`geom_text_repel()` function from the `ggrepel` package that is going to
automatically adjust their positions to avoid overlap.

```{r}
country_highlight <- c(
  "Germany", "Norway", "United States", "Greece", "Singapore", "Rwanda",
  "Russia", "Venezuela", "Sudan", "Iraq", "Ghana", "Niger", "Chad", "Kuwait",
  "Qatar", "Myanmar", "Nepal", "Chile", "Argentina", "Japan", "China"
)

corrupt <- corrupt %>%
  mutate(
    label = ifelse(country %in% country_highlight, country, "")
  )
```
<br>

That's it for the data preparation step! Let's build the chart now!

# Construct the plot
***

Unlike other guides in this series, this post goes straight to the point and 
builds the chart in a single chunk of code. The [original vignette](https://wilkelab.org/practicalgg/articles/corruption_human_development.html) 
is already an  excellent step-by-step guide on the construction of this plot. 
Some comments are still added within the code to explain what is going on in 
certain lines.

```{r, fig.height = 4.9, fig.width = 7, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center"}
# Okabe Ito colors
# The last color is used for the regression fit.
region_cols <- c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#999999")


ggplot(corrupt, aes(cpi, hdi)) +
  # Adding the regression fit before the points make sure the line stays behind the points.
  geom_smooth(
    aes(color = "y ~ log(x)", fill = "y ~ log(x)"),
    method = "lm",
    formula = y ~ log(x),
    se = FALSE, # Plot the line only (without confidence bands)
    fullrange = TRUE # The fit spans the full range of the horizontal axis
  ) +
  geom_point(
    aes(color = region, fill = region),
    size = 2.5, alpha = 0.5,
    shape = 21 # This is a dot with both border (color) and fill.
  ) +
  # Add auto-positioned text
  geom_text_repel(
    aes(label = label),
    color = "black",
    size = 9 / .pt, # font size 9 pt
    point.padding = 0.1,
    box.padding = 0.6,
    min.segment.length = 0,
    max.overlaps = 1000,
    seed = 7654 # For reproducibility reasons
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(
    name = NULL, # it's one way to omit the legend title
    values = darken(region_cols, 0.3) # dot borders are a darker than the fill
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(
    name = NULL,
    values = region_cols
  ) +
  # Add labels and customize axes
  scale_x_continuous(
    name = "Corruption Perceptions Index, 2015 (100 = least corrupt)",
    limits = c(10, 95),
    breaks = c(20, 40, 60, 80, 100),
    expand = c(0, 0) # This removes the default padding on the ends of the axis
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Human Development Index, 2015\n(1.0 = most developed)",
    limits = c(0.3, 1.05),
    breaks = c(0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0), # Manually set axis breaks
    expand = c(0, 0)
  ) +
  # Override default legend appearance
  guides(
    color = guide_legend(
      # All keys go in the same row.
      nrow = 1,
      override.aes = list(
        # 0 means no line, 1 is a solid line
        # The result is 5 keys with no line and 1 with a line
        linetype = c(rep(0, 5), 1),
        # Now, 5 keys with the marker number 21 (the one used in the plot)
        # and 1 key without this marker.
        shape = c(rep(21, 5), NA)
      )
    )
  ) +
  # Minimal grid theme that only draws horizontal lines
  theme_minimal_hgrid(12, rel_small = 1) +
  # Customize aspects of the legend
  theme(
    legend.position = "top",
    legend.justification = "right",
    legend.text = element_text(size = 9),
    legend.box.spacing = unit(0, "pt")
  )
```
