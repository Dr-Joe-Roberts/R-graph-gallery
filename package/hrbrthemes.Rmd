# Introduction
***
The `hrbrthemes` package in R serves as a valuable extension to the renowned [ggplot2](https://r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-package.html) package. Created by Bob Rudis, `hrbrthemes` offers a collection of **opinionated themes and typography settings** that aim to elevate the visual appeal of your ggplot2 plots. Whether you are a data scientist, a researcher, or anyone interested in data visualization, this package helps you create **publication-quality** plots with minimal effort.

# Installation and Setup
***
Before diving into the features, let's discuss how to get started with `hrbrthemes`. The package can be easily installed from CRAN using the `install.packages` function. Once installed, you can load it into your R session along with ggplot2 to start enhancing your plots.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("hrbrthemes")
library(hrbrthemes)
library(ggplot2)
```

# Basic usage

The `hrbrthemes` package offers a collection of opinionated **themes** that can be applied to your ggplot2 plots. These themes are designed to be visually appealing and publication-ready. They come with a set of **pre-configured settings** like font sizes, colors, and grid lines that adhere to good visualization practices.

Here's how you can apply the `theme_ipsum()` to a scatter plot:

```{r} 
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=mpg, y=disp)) + geom_point() + theme_ipsum()
```

# In-Depth Look at Features 
***

## Opinionated Themes
One of the standout features of `hrbrthemes` is its collection of opinionated themes. These themes, such as `theme_ipsum()`, `theme_modern_rc()`, and `theme_ft_rc()`, are designed to be visually appealing and publication-ready. They come with a set of pre-configured settings like font sizes, colors, and grid lines that adhere to good visualization practices.

Here's how you can apply the `theme_modern_rc()` to a scatter plot:

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=mpg, y=disp)) + geom_point() + theme_modern_rc()
```


## Typography Settings
Another key feature of `hrbrthemes` is its typography settings. These settings allow you to customize the fonts and font sizes of your plots. For example, you can change the font family of your plot to `serif` and increase the font size of the axis labels to 14 points.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=mpg, y=disp)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_ipsum_rc(base_family = "serif", base_size = 14)
```

## Grid Lines
`hrbrthemes` also offers a set of grid line settings that allow you to **customize the grid lines** of your plots. For example, you can change the color of the grid lines to `lightblue` and increase the thickness of the grid lines to 1.2 points. We have to use the `theme()` function to apply these settings, to **both the major and minor** grid lines.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=mpg, y=disp)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_ipsum() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 1.2, color = "lightblue")) +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_line(size = 1.2, color = "lightblue"))
```

## Custom Colors
The `hrbrthemes` package also offers a set of **custom colors** that can be used in your plots. You can use functions such as `scale_color_ipsum()` and `scale_fill_ipsum()` to apply these colors to your plots. For example, you can use the `scale_color_ipsum()` function to apply the `ipsum_blue()` color to the points in a scatter plot.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=mpg, y=disp)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(cyl))) +
  scale_color_ipsum() +
  theme_ipsum()
```

## Percent and comma scales
`hrbrthemes` also offers a set of **percent and comma scales** that can be used in your plots. These scales allow you to format the axis labels of your plots to include a percent sign or a comma. For example, you can use the `scale_x_percent()` function to format the x-axis labels of a scatter plot to include a percent sign.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=mpg, y=disp)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_percent() +
  theme_ipsum()
```
