# About
***

This page showcases the work of [Georgios Karamanis](https://karaman.is/), built 
for the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) initiative. 
You can find the original code on his Github repository [here](https://github.com/gkaramanis/tidytuesday/blob/master/2021/2021-week26/animal-rescues.R).

Thanks to him for accepting sharing his work here! Thanks also to 
[Tom√°s Capretto](https://tcapretto.netlify.app/) who split the original code 
into this step-by-step guide! üôèüôè

As a teaser, here is the plot we‚Äôre gonna try building:

# Load packages
***

Let's start by loading some libraries. On top of the `tidyverse`, today's plot also
depends on [`geofacet`](https://hafen.github.io/geofacet/) and 
[`ggh4x`](https://teunbrand.github.io/ggh4x/). The first one provides geofaceting 
functionality for ggplot2, and the later provides some utility functions such 
as the `stat_difference()` that is going to be used here.

**Note:** At the moment of writing, this guide uses the development version of 
`ggh4x` (v0.1.2.1.9), which can be installed from Github with

```r
devtools::install_github("teunbrand/ggh4x")
```
<br>

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(geofacet)
library(ggh4x)
```
<br>

**Fira Sans Compressed** is going to be the default font for the plot and
**KyivType Sans** is going to be used for the title. If you are a little unsure
about how to work with custom fonts in R, 
[this post](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/custom-fonts-in-R-and-ggplot2) is 
for you.


# Load and prepare the data
***

This guide shows how to create a highly customized and beautiful multi-panel 
lineplot to visualize the evolution of animal rescues by the London fire brigade 
for the different boroughs in the city.


The data for this post originally comes from [London.gov](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/animal-rescue-incidents-attended-by-lfb) 
by way of [Data is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/) and 
[Georgios Karamanis](https://www.karaman.is). This guide uses the dataset released 
for the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) initiative on
the week of 2021-06-29. You can find the original announcement and more information
about the data [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-06-29/readme.md). 
Thank you all for making this work possible! 

Let's get started by loading the dataset:

```{r}
animal_rescues <- readr::read_csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-06-29/animal_rescues.csv"
  ) %>% 
  # Capitalize the type of animal
  mutate(animal_group_parent = str_to_sentence(animal_group_parent))
```
<br>

The `geofacet` library imports grid layouts from the 
[grid-designer](https://github.com/hafen/grid-designer) repository. This repository 
has a lot of different grid layouts that represent the actual geographical layout
of a large variety of neighborhoods within cities, cities within states, or even states within countries.
Given that each borough in London represents a panel in today's viz, we load the dataset 
named `gb_london_boroughs_grid` which represents the layout of the boroughs in London.

```{r}
borough_names <- gb_london_boroughs_grid %>% 
  select(borough_code = code_ons, name)
```
<br>

Next, let's process the data a little.

```{r}
rescues_borough <- animal_rescues %>% 
  # Keep rescues that happeend before 2021
  filter(cal_year < 2021) %>% 
  # We're interested on whether it is a Cat or another type of animal.
  mutate(animal_group_parent = if_else(animal_group_parent == "Cat", "Cat", "Not_Cat")) %>% 
  # Count the number of rescues per year, borough, and type of animal
  count(cal_year, borough_code, animal_group_parent) %>% 
  # Make the dataset wider.
  # * One column for the number of cat rescues
  # * Another column for the number of other animal rescues
  pivot_wider(names_from = animal_group_parent, values_from = n) %>% 
  # Merge the data with the info about the grid layout
  left_join(borough_names) %>% 
  # Drop entries with missing name
  filter(!is.na(name)) 
```
<br>


# Basic lineplot
***

Today's chart consists of several lineplots that are arranged in a custom layout. 
Let's start by trying to create only one of the panels in the plot. 
This will be very helpful to understand all the details behind this wonderful 
chart.

```{r}
# Let's say we select the borough named "Enfield" 
df <- rescues_borough %>%
  filter(name == "Enfield")

ggplot(df, aes(x = cal_year)) +
  # One line for Cat rescues
  geom_line(aes(y = Cat, color = "cats")) +
  # Another line for Not_Cat rescues
  geom_line(aes(y = Not_Cat, color = "other")) +
  # stat_difference() from ggh4x package applies the conditional fill
  # based on which of Not_Cat and Cat is larger.
  stat_difference(aes(ymin = Not_Cat, ymax = Cat), alpha = 0.3)
```
<br>

# Multipanel layout via geofaceting
***

Fortunately, it's quite easy to extend the single-panel plot to a multi-panel 
plot with ggplot2. In this case, the `facet_geo()` function from the `geofacet` 
package is going to provide the faceting based on the different boroughs in 
London

```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=10, dpi=320, out.width="95%"}
plt <- ggplot(rescues_borough, aes(x = cal_year)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Cat, color = "cats")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Not_Cat, color = "other")) +
  stat_difference(aes(ymin = Not_Cat, ymax = Cat), alpha = 0.3) +
  # vars(name): Use the values in the name variable to create the subpanels
  # grid = "gb_london_boroughs_grid": use the London boroughs grid that comes
  # with the geofacet package
  facet_geo(vars(name), grid = "gb_london_boroughs_grid")

plt 
```
<br>

Wonderful! Sometimes it's hard to believe that only one extra line of code 
separates this plot from the previous one.

# Annotations, scales, and colors
***

While geofaceting is really cool, it's still necessary to improve the appearance
of the plot. The first improvement is to use more attractive colors for the 
lines and the fill -- having different colors for these geoms does not feel quite
right in this case. 
Then, breaks are manually specified for both axes. And finally,
a title and a caption are added to give more information about the content
of the plot and the source of the data.

```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=10, dpi=320, out.width="95%"}
plt <- plt + 
  # Colors for the lines
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#3D85F7", "#C32E5A")) +
  # Colors for the fill. They are lighter versions of the line colors.
  # The third one is required because lines are sometimes equal
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(
      colorspace::lighten("#3D85F7"), 
      colorspace::lighten("#C32E5A"), 
      "grey60"
    ),
    labels = c("more cats", "more other", "same")
  ) +
  # Set breaks along both axes
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2010, 2020, 5)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 20, 10)) +
  # Add labels
  labs(
    title = "Rescues of\ncats vs other animals by\nthe London fire brigade\n2009-2020",
    caption = "Source: London.gov ¬∑ Graphic: Georgios Karamanis"
  ) +
  # Specify the order for the guides
  guides(
    # Order indicates the order of each legend among multiple guides.
    # The guide for 'color' will be placed before the onde for 'fill'
    color = guide_legend(order = 1), 
    fill = guide_legend(order = 2)
  ) 

plt
```
<br>

The plot is one step closer to its final version but some details need to be 
taken care of before it is ready. For example, panel labels need extra space in 
order to fit and the default theme is just too boring. Let's work on those final
tweaks!

# Final chart
***

Now it's time to **customize the theme**. First of all, the default font is 
replaced with **Fira Sans Compressed**. This is a slight change that makes the 
plot look much better. Then, the legend is shifted to a much better position on 
the top-right corner of the plot. The default takes valuable horizontal space 
and does not take advantage of the extra space due to the empty panels. And 
finally, we customize the background color as well as the styles for the title 
and the caption. Just note how better the viz looks thanks to using the 
**KyivType Sans** font for the title.


```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=10, dpi=320, out.width="95%"}
plt <- plt + 
  # A minimalistic theme with no background annotations
  theme_minimal(base_family = "Fira Sans Compressed") +
  theme(
    # Top-right position
    legend.pos = c(0.875, 0.975),
    # Elements within a guide are placed one next to the other in the same row
    legend.direction = "horizontal",
    # Different guides are stacked vertically
    legend.box = "vertical",
    # No legend title
    legend.title = element_blank(),
    # Light background color
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#F5F4EF", color = NA),
    plot.margin = margin(20, 30, 20, 30),
    # Customize the title. Note the new font family and its larger size.
    plot.title = element_text(
      margin = margin(0, 0, -100, 0), 
      size = 26, 
      family = "KyivType Sans", 
      face = "bold", 
      vjust = 0, 
      color = "grey25"
    ),
    plot.caption = element_text(size = 11),
    # Remove titles for x and y axes.
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    # Specify color for the tick labels along both axes 
    axis.text = element_text(color = "grey40"),
    # Specify face and color for the text on top of each panel/facet
    strip.text = element_text(face = "bold", color = "grey20")
  )

plt
