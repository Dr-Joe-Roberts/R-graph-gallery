# About
***

This page showcases the work of [Tuo Wang](https://tuowang.rbind.io/) that 
introduces packages to make [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) plots 
more beautiful. You can find the original code on Tuo's blog 
[here](https://tuowang.rbind.io/post/2021-03-25-ggplot2-extensions/)

Thanks to him for accepting sharing his work here! Thanks also to 
[Tom√°s Capretto](https://tcapretto.netlify.app/) who split the original code 
into this step-by-step guide! üôèüôè

## Load packages
***

Let's start by loading the packages needed to build the figure. 
[ggradar](https://github.com/ricardo-bion/ggradar) is the star of the day.
This package does only one thing, but it does it very well. Thanks to it,
making `ggplot2` based radar charts is extremely easy.


**Note:** `ggradar` can be installed from github with 
`remotes::install_github("ricardo-bion/ggradar")`.


```{r}
library(ggradar)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
library(showtext)
```

Use `font_add_google()` to download fonts. The second argument is an (optional) 
alias that will be used throughout the plot.

```{r}
font_add_google("Lobster Two", "lobstertwo")
font_add_google("Roboto", "roboto")

# Showtext will be automatically invoked when needed
showtext_auto()
```

Another option would be to use the [`ragg`](https://ragg.r-lib.org/) library for
the backend. With `ragg`, all the fonts installed in your computer are available
can be used to build charts without having to use `showtext`.

# Load and prepare the dataset
***

Today's data were collected and made available by 
[Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) 
and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pal.lternet.edu/), a member of 
the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/). This dataset 
was popularized by [Allison Horst](https://www.allisonhorst.com/) in her R 
package [`palmerpenguins`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) with 
the goal to offer an alternative to the iris dataset for data exploration and 
visualization.

```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
head(penguins, 3)
```

<br>


After dropping observations with missing values, it's necessary to compute the 
mean value for the numerical variables that will be displayed in the radar chart. 
Then, with the aid of the `rescale()` function from the `scales` pacakge, 
these summaries are rescaled to the [0, 1] interval.

```{r}
penguins_radar <- penguins %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm),
    avg_bill_dept = mean(bill_depth_mm),
    avg_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm),
    avg_body_mass = mean(body_mass_g)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate_at(vars(-species), rescale)
```

<br>

## Basic radar chart
***

Creating a radar chart with `ggradar` is as easy as calling `ggradar(data)`.
In this case, the pipe operator `%>%` is used to pass the data frame to the 
function.

```{r}
plt <- penguins_radar %>%
  ggradar(
    font.radar = "roboto",
    grid.label.size = 13,  # Affects the grid annotations (0%, 50%, etc.)
    axis.label.size = 8.5, # Afftects the names of the variables
    group.point.size = 3   # Simply the size of the point 
  )
```
  
```{r, include=FALSE}
ggsave(
  filename = here::here("img", "fromTheWeb", "web-radar-chart-with-R-preview1.png"),
  plot = plt,
  width = 5.7,
  height = 5,
  device = "png"
)
```

<center>
![](img/fromTheWeb/web-radar-chart-with-R-preview1.png){width=80%}
</center>

Can we make it better than that? Of course! Let's keep working on it.

## Custom legend

The chart above has nice default colors and axis guides, that's great for such a
few lines of code! 

The next step is to make it prettier. Let's get started by fixing the overlap 
in the legend and making some adjustments.


```{r}
# 1. Set the position legend to bottom-right
# 2. Bottom-right justification
# 3. Customize text size and family
# 4. Remove background and border color for the keys
# 5. Remove legend background
plt <- plt + 
  theme(
    legend.position = c(1, 0),  
    legend.justification = c(1, 0),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 28, family = "roboto"),
    legend.key = element_rect(fill = NA, color = NA),
    legend.background = element_blank()
  )
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
ggsave(
  filename = here::here("img", "fromTheWeb", "web-radar-chart-with-R-preview2.png"),
  plot = plt,
  width = 5.7,
  height = 5,
  device = "png"
)
```

<br>

<center>
![](img/fromTheWeb/web-radar-chart-with-R-preview2.png){width=80%}
</center>

Very nice! It's amazing what can be done with just two small chunks of code.

## Final chart
***
  
The chart above is pretty close from being publication ready. What's needed now 
is a good title and final touches to the layout:

```{r}
# * The panel is the drawing region, contained within the plot region.
#   panel.background refers to the plotting area
#   plot.background refers to the entire plot
plt <- plt + 
  labs(title = "Radar plot of penguins species") + 
  theme(
      plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#fbf9f4", color = "#fbf9f4"),
      panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#fbf9f4", color = "#fbf9f4"),
      plot.title.position = "plot", # slightly different from default
      plot.title = element_text(
        family = "lobstertwo", 
        size = 62,
        face = "bold", 
        color = "#2a475e"
    )
  )
```

<br>

And finally, save the result.

```{r}
ggsave(
  filename = here::here("img", "fromTheWeb", "web-radar-chart-with-R.png"),
  plot = plt,
  width = 5.7,
  height = 5,
  device = "png"
)
```
